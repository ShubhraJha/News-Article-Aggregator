It meant they got a negative score on the grade of execution, a fatal blow in an Olympic final.\n\n\"It was just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we'd lost bronze at that point,\" Fear told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that so it's this battle of taking it in and doing my best the rest of the way while also knowing what I'd just done.\n\n\"And it's not what we've trained, it was costly and devastating.\"\n\nThey skated clean thereafter and got good scores in their rousing finish \u2013 a series of Highland jigs combined with a dance lift - but the damage was done, as their overall technical score suffered greatly.\n\nIt was clear from their faces that they knew they had not been perfect. Fear had appeared nervous before the routine and looked devastated afterwards as it became clear that the pressure told.\n\n\"When you don't perform the way you want to, on any day, it's tough to take but at the Olympic Games, it's even harder,\" Gibson said.\n\n\"I think we'll look back at this one day and 100% learn from it. We do that at every single event that we go to and compete in. We'll just move forward.\"\n\nThe 'Disco Brits' are the darlings of British figure skating, and are popular internationally for their vibrant, skilful routines.\n\nAnd they have had an impressive year in which they became the first Brits to win a medal at a World Championship for 40 years; they also got on the podium in Sheffield at their home European Championships. But there will be no Olympic medal to round it off.\n\nBritain's other representatives Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez, who made the final stage on their Olympic debuts aged just 24 and 20 respectively, finished 17th after setting a season-best overall score of 179.45."

    "content": "When Thomas Tuchel took charge of England it seemed like it was going to be a quick in and out.\n\nThe German signed an 18-month contract to see him through England's World Cup campaign.\n\nThen, he was expected to return to club management.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich coach would likely have had the pick of many top jobs in the summer.\n\nManchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are just two clubs who would have had him on their radar.\n\nInstead, he has committed his future to the Three Lions.\n\nThe England job has proved to be an excellent fit for the 52-year-old.\n\nBefore the November internationals, Tuchel said he had enjoyed \"the level of support and trust\" the Football Association offered. So we should not be surprised he has now decided to stay on.\n\nTuchel has always spoken highly of the Premier League but could not walk away from leading England at a home tournament.\n\nIt is good news for the FA, too. The last thing it wanted was to deal with months of speculation not only over Tuchel's position, but who would replace him.\n\nNow it can plan for the home Euros with continuity, and a coach who has got results.\n\nIt is not without pitfalls, of course. If England underperform at the World Cup, questions over his future will be asked.\n\nBut Tuchel's record so far means both parties do not see this as a risky move."

    "content": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself."

    "content": "Following Forest's 0-0 draw with Wolves on Wednesday, Dyche sounded like a man who knew what was to follow.\n\nAfter an incredible 35 attempts on goal without scoring - more attempts than any team Dyche has managed in his 351 games in charge - the draw left them just three points clear of the drop zone.\n\nA frustrated Marinakis was pictured frequently during the City Ground draw with him appearing to be growing increasingly frustrated with every missed opportunity.\n\nPost match - and before his dismissal - Dyche said: \"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt. If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it.\n\n\"People can demand change, and then it's always whether they change or not.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"I understand the noise here has changed significantly since the last few games.\"\n\nDyche undoubtedly arrived at Forest in difficult circumstances, but he appeared to steady the ship after a poor run of results under Postecoglou, winning seven of his first 12 games.\n\nIf results were taken from when Dyche took over, Forest would be mid-table, six points above third-from-bottom Tottenham.\n\nHe was even nominated for Premier League manager of the month a week ago, with two wins and one loss from their past six matches.\n\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, just an hour before Dyche's dismissal, ex-England striker Alan Shearer backed the former Burnley boss.\n\nHe said: \"I think with his know-how and his experience in the Premier League, I would without a doubt stick with Sean.\"\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, added: \"I think for this battle at the bottom you wouldn't want a better manager than him.\n\n\"He's been there, done it, he stays calm. I think they'd be crazy to get rid of him.\n\n\"The other thing as well I suppose for Marinakis is if it wasn't for him they wouldn't be in the Premier League and they wouldn't be in Europe.\n\n\"So maybe he's got the right to do what he wants, but I don't think there's a manager you could bring in who is as capable as [Dyche] in this fight.\""

    "content": "The 40-point mark - or thereabouts - could be needed once again to guarantee Premier League survival this term, with an in-form West Ham attempting to chase down the sides above them.\n\nThat mythical number has often been cited as the threshold at which managers, players and fans can relax - but the total has not actually been needed to stay up since 2010-11.\n\nPrior to that the only other occasions clubs were demoted with 40 points or more were 1996-97, 1997-98 and 2002-03.\n\nBut could that be about to change?\n\nWest Ham, who are 18th in the top flight, are only three points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, who sacked manager Sean Dyche after Wednesday's goalless draw with Wolves.\n\nWhile Tottenham - who sacked boss Thomas Frank on Wednesday - are 16th, another two points ahead of Forest.\n\nWith 12 games remaining history shows the Hammers are more than capable of surviving, and in Nuno Espirito Santo they have a manager who knows what it takes to stay up from his time at Forest.\n\nWest Ham's current points tally (24) is the most by any side in 18th at this stage of a campaign since 2019-20, when the Hammers recovered to stay up with 39 points.\n\nAnd they are arguably the form club in the lower reaches of the table, with three wins helping them take 10 points from their past five games.\n\nLeeds also look to have found some momentum with recent wins over Fulham and Forest as well as draws at Everton and Chelsea.\n\nIn contrast Spurs have managed a meagre four points from the previous 27 available to them.\n\nMeanwhile, now managerless Forest have won just two of their past 10 games and fans of Brighton and Crystal Palace may also be looking over their shoulders.\n\nThe 14th-placed Seagulls (31 points) are on a dismal run having won just one top-flight game since 30 November.\n\nPalace - who are a place and a point above Brighton - have only tasted victory once since 7 December and most recently let a two-goal lead slip as they lost to struggling Burnley."

Only two survivors were rescued.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration said the boat overturned north of Zuwara on Friday, in the latest disaster involving people attempting the perilous Mediterranean crossing in the hope of reaching Europe.\n\nIn a statement, the IOM said: \u201cOnly two Nigerian women were rescued during a search and rescue operation by Libyan authorities.\u201d It added that one of the survivors said she lost her husband and the other said she lost her two babies in the tragedy.\n\nThe agency said its teams provided the survivors with emergency medical care upon disembarkation. \u201cAccording to survivor accounts, the boat \u2013 carrying migrants and refugees of African nationalities departed from Al-Zawiya, Libya, at around 11pm on February 5. Approximately six hours later, it capsized after taking on water,. IOM mourns the loss of life in yet another deadly incident along the Central Mediterranean route.\u201d\n\nThe Geneva-based agency said trafficking and smuggling networks were exploiting migrants along the route from north Africa to southern Europe, profiting from dangerous crossings in unseaworthy boats while exposing people to \u201csevere abuse\u201d.\n\nIt called for stronger international cooperation to tackle the networks alongside safe and regular migration pathways to reduce risks and save lives. The IOM fears that hundreds of people have died since the start of the year attempting to cross the Mediterranean amid harsh weather conditions on the dangerous crossing.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said Brussels was trying to address the root causes of irregular migration and promote legal, safe and orderly pathways to the European Union. \u201cThese tragic events once again underline the need to intensify joint efforts with our partners, including Libya, to prevent such dangerous journeys and to combat the criminal networks of migrant smugglers that put lives at risk,\u201d they told Agence France-Presse.\n\nBetween the start of 2014 and the end of 2025, more than 33,000 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean, according to the IOM\u2019s Missing Migrants Project.\n\nLast year, it recorded 1,873 missing or dead in the Mediterranean, including 1,342 on the central route."

    "content": "Ghanaian musician Ebo Taylor, a definitive force behind the highlife genre, has died age 90.\n\nHis son Kweku Taylor announced the news on Sunday: \u201cThe world has lost a giant. A colossus of African music. Ebo Taylor passed away yesterday; a day after the launch of Ebo Taylor music festival and exactly a month after his 90th birthday, leaving behind an unmatched artistry legacy. Dad, your light will never fade.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Ghanaian president told the BBC\u2019s Newsday programme that Taylor would \u201cbe remembered as one of our greatest musicians ever ... a man who strove to put Ghanaian music on the global map at a time when other genres of music were prominent\u201d.\n\nA recent interview on the music website Passion of the Weiss hailed Taylor as \u201cthe greatest rhythm guitarist in history \u2026 with complete originality, he incorporated the diverse rhythmic traditions of the Ga, Ewe, Dagomba and his own Akan people into his compositions.\u201d\n\nTaylor was born Deroy Taylor on Ghana\u2019s Cape Coast on 6 January 1936. He started playing piano at the age of six, his tastes shaped by American and English music, in part as a result of Ghana being a British colony at the time.\n\nGrowing up during the blossoming of highlife, he switched to guitar while he was at college, and subsequently joined the Stargazers \u2013 whose members Teddy Osei and Sol Amarfio would later form the UK-based Afro-rock band Osibisa \u2013 and a succession of other bands. He became known for his rare embrace of both highlife \u2013 largely played in a major mode \u2013 and Afrobeat, which hews to minor modes.\n\nView image in fullscreen Taylor at the 2011 Womad festival. Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns\n\nAt the Eric Gilder School of Music in London in the early 1960s, Taylor studied Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and cited the complexity of the Czech composer\u2019s music as an influence on his own. But he also said that he learned more outside of the classroom, by sitting in with bands and attending jazz and highlife jams, and meeting acts including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nAt the time, Nigerian musician Fela Kuti was studying at Trinity College in the capital. The pair became friends, bonding over a common interest in highlife and often jamming together. \u201cWe also had the desire to become a Miles Davis, a Charlie Christian, or a Kenny Burrell,\u201d Taylor told Post Genre in 2025. \u201cSo we had the same mood \u2026 He was such a playful and lively person.\u201d\n\nThe two musicians became genre innovators. In 2014, Taylor told the BBC that \u201cwith the advent of James Brown and funk music there was the opportunity to develop highlife music. Fela did a lot of work introducing the funk into the Yoruba music while comparatively I did almost the same thing in Ghana.\u201d\n\nTaylor credited Kuti with encouraging him to write distinctly African music, and he combined the influence of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Davis with a strong sense of his own musical traditions, both from Ghana and his Malian grandmother. \u201cI do believe that it is important for music to progress, otherwise it just becomes something for museums, but you have to know your traditional culture before you start addings things to it,\u201d he told the Vinyl Factory in 2018.\n\nAfter forming the Black Star Highlife Band in London in 1964, he returned to his home country a year later, and formed bands including the New Broadway Dance Band and the Blue Monks, which both featured, for a time, fellow Ghanaian musician Pat Thomas.\n\nView image in fullscreen Taylor performing in Spain in 2012. Photograph: Esteban Martinena Guerrero/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nIn the early 70s, Taylor worked as in-house guitarist, arranger and producer at the Essiebons label, run by Dick Essilfie-Bondzie, a former government worker turned music impresario who released what a 2021 reissue called \u201cthe best in modern highlife\u201d. Taylor recorded several of his own albums for the label and worked on records by artists such as Thomas and Gyedu-Blay Ambolley.\n\nIn the 80s, Taylor stepped back from fronting his own bands to work on other artists\u2019 records. In the 2000s, he taught music at the University of Ghana.\n\nHis first internationally released album, Love and Death, came out in 2010. Taylor\u2019s music had become more widely disseminated thanks to increased international interest in highlife, which was the subject of many reissue records and compilations. His songs were also sampled by artists including Usher, the Black Eyed Peas, Kelly Rowland, Jidenna and Vic Mensa. Love and Death prompted a renewed run of activity for Taylor, which included the albums Appia Kwa Bridge (2012) and Yen Ara (2018), and international touring.\n\nIn 2018, Taylor had a stroke that impaired his ability to speak English. For the 2025 album Ebo Taylor JID022, a collaboration with Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge\u2019s Jazz Is Dead project, his son Henry facilitated communication between the three musicians \u2013 and played guitar on the project himself. Taylor also often played with his son Roy. It is unclear how many children Taylor had; his eldest son Ebo Taylor Jr died in 2022.\n\nAt the age of 90, Taylor was no longer able to play guitar. He lived much of his life, including his later years, in the small coastal city of Saltpond, where he was known locally as Uncle Ebo. He received several lifetime achievement awards from organisations representing Ghanaian and highlife music.\n\nThe contemporary singer and rapper Black Sherif paid tribute to Taylor: \u201cWe lost a legend whose contribution to music has created worldwide ripples. I take solace in the fact that I witnessed greatness in Uncle Ebo Taylor\u2019s art form. Rest In Power!\u201d"

    "content": "Spain and Portugal have endured another storm over the weekend, just days after the deadly flooding and major damage caused by Storm Kristin and Storm Leonardo last week. Storm Marta passed over the Iberian peninsula on Saturday, bringing fresh torrential rain and killing two people. Storm Kristin killed at least five people after it made landfall on 28 January with Storm Leonardo claiming another victim last Wednesday.\n\nThe outlook for this week is for more rain across Spain, Portugal and France, especially across north-west Portugal, where more than 100mm is possible during the first half of the week. Some of the heaviest of the rain will transfer to southern Italy and western parts of Greece and Turkey later in the week.\n\nHigh rainfall totals are also expected across parts of South Africa and Lesotho this week. By Saturday, provinces including the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape in South Africa could record fairly widespread rainfall totals of 80-100mm as a result of heavy showers or thunderstorms, with daily rainfall totals perhaps reaching 50mm where storms are particularly intense.\n\nAlready, the South African Weather Service has issued warnings and advisories for severe thunderstorms through the first half of this week with a risk of excessive lightning, gusty winds, and hail. As a result, flooding, mudslides, and infrastructure damage is expected, potentially affecting more than 10 million people.\n\nJapan and Korea continued to be gripped by cold weather last week as temperatures remained below average, reaching a peak over the weekend. Temperatures in Tokyo fell to almost 10C below average on Sunday as temperatures struggled to rise above zero, with snow falling too.\n\nTokyo sits on a similar latitude to the most northern parts of Africa and Athens, but despite this, snow is not unheard of, occurring on average about once or twice a year. This is due to Japan being positioned between a cold northerly flow from continental eastern Asia, as well as a supply of moisture from both the Sea of Japan to the north and the Philippine Sea to the south.\n\nWestern areas of Japan tend to see the most significant snowfall, as was the case this time with the Hokuriku region seeing more than 50cm in 24 hours. Temperatures are expected to quickly rise through later this week, reaching the mid to high teens in Tokyo by the weekend."

    "content": "A drone attack by a paramilitary group has hit a vehicle carrying displaced families in central Sudan, killing at least 24 people, including eight children, a doctors\u2019 group said on Saturday.\n\nThe attack by the Rapid Support Forces took place close to the city of Er Rahad in North Kordofan province, according to the Sudan Doctors Network, which tracks the country\u2019s war. The vehicle was transporting displaced people who fled fighting in the Dubeiker area, the group said in a statement. Among the dead children were two infants.\n\nSeveral others were wounded and taken for treatment in Er Rahad, which suffers from severe medical supplies shortages, like many areas in the Kordofan region, the statement said.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group urged the international community and rights organisations to \u201ctake immediate action to protect civilians and hold the RSF leadership directly accountable for these violations\u201d.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the RSF, which has been at war against the Sudanese military for control of the country for about three years.\n\nSudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country, leaving tens of thousands dead and millions displaced.\n\nA drone attack on Friday on a World Food Programme (WFP) aid convoy in North Kordofan province killed one and wounded several others, said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.\n\nBrown said the convoy was heading to deliver \u201clife-saving food assistance\u201d to displaced people in the city of El Obeid in North Kordofan when it was struck. The attack burned the trucks and destroyed the aid, she said.\n\n\u201cAttacks on aid operations undermine efforts to reach people facing hunger and displacement,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nLast week, a drone strike hit close to a WFP facility in the Blue Nile province, wounding a WFP worker, Brown said.\n\nEmergency Lawyers, an independent group documenting atrocities in Sudan, blamed the RSF for the attack, while the Sudan Doctors Network called it a \u201cflagrant violation of international humanitarian law [which] amounts to a full-fledged war crime\u201d.\n\nMassad Boulos, a US adviser for African and Arab affairs, condemned the attack on X and called for holding those responsible accountable.\n\n\u201cDestroying food intended for people in need and killing humanitarian workers is sickening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Trump administration has zero tolerance for this destruction of life and of US-funded assistance; we demand accountability.\u201d\n\nThe British minister for international development and Africa, Jenny Chapman, called the attack on the WFP convoy \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\n\n\u201cCivilians are starving,\u201d she wrote on Saturday on X. \u201cAid workers and humanitarian operations bringing vital food should never be targeted.\u201d\n\nIn a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the RSF for its recent drone strikes, including on the vehicle of displaced families, the WFP convoy and on a hospital in Kordofan that killed 22 people.\n\nThe Saudi statement called for the RSF to stop its attacks on civilians and aid convoys, and called out foreign parties that continue to \u201cdeliver illegal arms, mercenaries and foreign fighters\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused by rights groups and UN experts of arming the paramilitary group. The UAE has denied the accusations.\n\nIn recent months, Kordofan has become a flashpoint in the war and the army managed to break the RSF siege of two major cities in the region earlier this year.\n\nThe devastating war has so far killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher.\n\nIt created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis with more than 14 million people forced to flee their homes. It has fuelled disease outbreaks and pushed parts of the country into a famine that still spreads as the war shows no sign of abating.\n\nIn a report released on Thursday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said famine was found in two more areas in the western region of Darfur where famine was confirmed for the first time in a displacement camp in August 2024.\n\nThe report warned that acute malnutrition is expected to worsen in 2026, with a 13.5% increase in cases of acute malnutrition in children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women \u2013 from 3.7 million children and women in 2025 to nearly 4.2 million in 2026.\n\nSevere acute malnutrition, the most dangerous and deadly form of malnutrition, is expected to increase to 800,000 cases, up 4% from 2025, it said.\n\nMohamed Abdiladif, the country director for Save the Children in Sudan, said children were already dying from hunger-related causes in many parts of Sudan.\n\n\u201cEvery day we hear devastating stories of parents selling the last of what they own simply to keep their children alive from one day to the next,\u201d he said."

    "content": "Demonstrations across Malawi\u2019s four main cities during the past week have achieved a delay in the introduction of a new tax regime that business owners claim will cripple their livelihoods.\n\nTens of thousands had signed petitions which this week were presented to tax officials and on Monday thousands of small traders shut up shops and businesses to hold protest marches in Blantyre, Lilongwe, Zomba and Mzuzu.\n\nThe actions have achieved a delay in the rollout of the electronic invoicing system (EIS) introduced by the Malawi Revenue Authority, a more detailed tax regime than existed previously. Due to be introduced this week, a transition to the system has now been postponed until April.\n\nIt was the latest sign of unrest in a country facing significant problems tackling aid cuts, foreign currency shortages, and resulting rises in the cost of necessities. Protests over food and fuel prices in September and November were hijacked by political groups, with outbreaks of violence.\n\nPresident Peter Mutharika, elected last year with a promise to restore the economy, has carried out adjustments to fuel, electricity and VAT, with fuel prices rising by 41% and electricity by 12%.\n\nThose who closed their shops and walked to tax offices, dressed in black and carrying placards criticising the revenue authority for prioritising \u201chitting the target\u201d of revenue collection and \u201ccelebrating\u201d while vendors are having to shutter their businesses, are especially struggling over import and export of goods.\n\nA shortage of foreign currency, they say, is pushing them to buy the dollar for imports at almost three times the bank rate.\n\n\u201cOur businesses are under threat because of the economy,\u201d said Robert Nachamba, a representative of small business owners, after a group of 1,000 protesters delivered their petition at the Blantyre revenue authority offices.\n\n\u201cThe country does not have foreign currency in the banks and now the Malawi Revenue Authority is coming with issues that threaten our businesses even further.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about how tough things are in the country, our pain is that there is a lack of foreign exchange which forces us to buy it on the black market because it is not available in the banks. Now we have already got it at an abnormally high rate and now we need to declare the prices of goods to the tax authorities? This will make the prices of our commodities higher even compared with our neighbouring countries and we don\u2019t need that system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe closed our shops and travelled to submit our petitions. That is why they were peaceful because we can\u2019t destroy our own shops.\u201d\n\nMalawi\u2019s minister of finance, Joseph Mwanamvekha, has told citizens to \u201cremain resilient\u201d as the government implements tough economic measures to stabilise the economy, cut expenditure and \u201cimprove revenue collection\u201d.\n\nBut economists warn that while the measures are technically rational \u2013 including the introduction of the electronic invoicing system to improve administration and combat tax evasion \u2013 businesses in the informal sector need to survive.\n\nMalawian economist Bertha Bangara-Chikadza told the Guardian: \u201cThe [policies] are being implemented under extreme macroeconomic challenges. If the government can use the resulting revenue to stabilise the economy and improve public services, it may indeed be a good step. However, if the increased tax burden fails to translate into improved infrastructure and energy, it risks further straining an economy.\u201d\n\nMalawi is the latest in a string of African economies, including Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Uganda, to implement mandatory electronic invoicing and \u201creal-time tax reporting systems\u201d as part of a trend to improve revenue collection and reduce fraud."

    "content": "Canadian police have identified the suspect who carried out a school massacre in remote British Columbia as an 18-year old with a history of mental health problems.\n\nSix people, including a teacher and five students, were killed in the attack on Tuesday in the town of Tumbler Ridge, in the foothills of the Rocky mountains. The suspect\u2019s mother and step-brother were later found dead at the family home, police said. The body of the shooter, Jesse Van Rootselaar, was also found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe incident was one of the worst mass casualty events in Canada\u2019s recent history.\n\n\u201cThis is a deeply distressing incident where nine individuals have senselessly lost their lives,\u201d said Dwayne McDonald, deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, at a briefing on Wednesday in which he revised the death toll down to nine from the initially reported 10.\n\nIn a somber update to a tragedy that has shaken the country, McDonald said one of the victims believed to have succumbed to her injuries had survived but remains in critical condition.\n\nAmid questions over how Van Rootselaar was described in alerts, McDonald said police \u201cidentified the suspect as they chose to be identified\u201d in public and in social media.\n\n\u201cI can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who, approximately six years ago, began to transition to female and identified as female, both socially and publicly,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to police, Van Rootselaar, arrived at a Tumbler Ridge secondary school on Tuesday afternoon, armed with a long gun and a modified handgun. The shooter opened fire on staff and students, killing one teacher and five students, whose ages ranged from 12 to 13.\n\nPolice arrived within two minutes of the shooting and were fired upon. When they entered the school, they found the victims in a stairwell and a classroom. The body of the shooter was also found.\n\nPolice later visited the family home and found Van Rootselaar\u2019s mother, 39, and 11-year-old step-brother dead from gunshot wounds. According to RCMP deputy commissioner Dwayne McDonald, the deaths at the family home occurred prior to the school shooting, CBC reported.\n\nMcDonald said police had responded to Van Rootselaar\u2019s home for mental health-related calls over the last several years, with some of the calls concerning weapons. He said that, on at least one occasion, firearms had been seized from the home, and the lawful owner of the firearms had petitioned to have them returned.\n\nMcDonald cautioned that the investigation remained in its early stages and police could not yet comment on a possible motive.\n\nSpeaking to CBC, Tumbler Ridge resident Dennis Campbell said his daughter had just been coming out of one of the school\u2019s bathrooms when the shooting began. According to Campbell, his daughter ran to the gym and hid in the gym.\n\n\u201cDad, there\u2019s a shooting, there\u2019s a shooting here,\u201d Campbell recalled his daughter saying, adding that she was mourning the loss of four of her friends.\n\nThe prime minister, Mark Carney, said: \u201cWhat happened has left our nation in shock and all of us in mourning.\n\n\u201cThese children and their teachers bore witness to unheard-of cruelty. I want everyone to know this: our entire country stands with you, on behalf of all Canadians,\u201d he said in an emotional address following a minute of silence in parliament.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers in the House of Commons following the moment of silence, Carney said:\n\n\u201cTumbler Ridge \u2026 is one of the youngest towns in the great province of British Columbia, carved out of the wilderness in the 1980s, built on the promise of the resource economy and by the determination of its residents. It\u2019s a town of miners, teachers, construction workers, families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there.\u201d\n\nCarney, who had already suspended plans to travel to Germany for the high-level Munich security conference, said he had ordered flags on all government buildings be flown at half-mast for the next seven days.\n\n\u201cWe will get through this. We will learn from this,\u201d he told reporters earlier in the day, at one point looking close to tears.\n\n\u201cBut right now, it\u2019s a time to come together, as Canadians always do in these situations, these terrible situations, to support each other, to mourn together and to grow together.\u201d\n\nThe attack has left people reeling in Canada, where mass shootings are rare, especially compared with the US. While the country has relatively high levels of gun ownership, it has imposed much stricter laws than its southern neighbour, including a ban on assault-style firearms and a freeze on the sale of handguns.\n\nCarney said he was also dispatching the federal public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree, to the small community of Tumbler Ridge, an isolated town of fewer than 2,500 residents, more than 1,000km (600 miles) north-east of Vancouver by road.\n\nView image in fullscreen Students walk out of the school building with their hands up after an assailant opened fire in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, Tuesday. Photograph: Western Standard/Jordon Kosik/Reuters\n\nAt least two other people were hospitalised with serious or life-threatening wounds, and as many as 25 people were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nThe town\u2019s mayor, Darryl Krakowka, said the small community was like a \u201cbig family\u201d.\n\n\u201cI broke down,\u201d Krakowka said. \u201cI have lived here for 18 years. I probably know every one of the victims.\u201d\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s public safety minister, Nina Krieger, has said \u201cspeed and professionalism\u201d had saved lives, and that a small detachment from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had \u201cresponded in two minutes\u201d.\n\nA 12-year-old girl was said to be \u201cfighting for her life\u201d in a Vancouver hospital after being shot in the head and neck, according to a widely shared Facebook post local media said was written by the girl\u2019s mother, Cia Edmonds.\n\n\u201cShe was a lucky one, I suppose. Condolences to the other families during this tragedy,\u201d the post read. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t even feel real.\u201d\n\nThe district of Tumbler Ridge issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, calling the shooting a \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d incident. \u201cWe recognise that many residents may be feeling shocked, scared and overwhelmed,\u201d the district said. \u201cIn the days ahead, we know this will be difficult for many to process. Please check in on one another, lean on available supports, and know that Tumbler Ridge is a strong and caring community.\u201d\n\nThe Tumbler Ridge secondary school has 160 students in grades seven to 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website. The school will be closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said.\n\n\u201cOur priority at this time is taking care of each other and re-establishing a sense of safety in our community,\u201d school officials said.\n\n\u201cThere are no words that can ease the fear and pain that events like this cause in a school community,\u201d the Tumbler Ridge parent advisory council said in a statement. \u201cWe want families to know that the safety and wellbeing of students and staff are paramount, and we are grateful to the first responders and emergency personnel who acted quickly and professionally.\u201d\n\nThe attack is the second-deadliest school shooting in Canadian history. In 1989, a gunman killed 14 students at Montreal\u2019s L\u2019Ecole Polytechnique in an attack that targeted women. In 2016, five people were killed in a series of shootings in La Loche, Saskatchewan.\n\nAfter the country\u2019s deadliest mass shooting attack, which left 22 people dead in Nova Scotia in 2020, Canada banned about 1,500 models of assault weapons.\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s premier, David Eby, called Tuesday\u2019s attack an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d.\n\nAs a father of three, Eby said news of the shooting \u201cmakes you want to hug your kids a little tighter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWrap these families with love. Not just tonight but tomorrow and into the future. This is something that will reverberate for years to come,\u201d he said."

    "content": "The US House on Wednesday voted to rescind tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on Canada last year, a rare bipartisan rebuke of the White House\u2019s trade policy as the president threatened electoral retaliation against any Republican who defied him.\n\nThe largely symbolic resolution to disapprove of the national emergency Trump declared to impose tariffs on Canada passed 219 to 211, with six Republicans \u2013 Don Bacon of Nebraska, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Kevin Kiley of California, Dan Newhouse of Washington and Jeff Hurd of Colorado \u2013 voting with all Democrats except Jared Golden of Maine, who voted against it.\n\n\u201cAny Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social before the vote was finalized, adding: \u201cTARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.\u201d\n\nUndoing Trump\u2019s tariff policy would ultimately require his approval, which was unlikely. On Wednesday, he warned Republicans against voting for the resolution, which GOP leaders had worked to forestall.\n\n\u201cCanada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,\u201d Trump wrote in a separate post. \u201cThey are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!\u201d\n\nThe measure next goes to the Senate.\n\nTrump believes in the power of tariffs to force trading partners to the negotiating table. But US lawmakers are facing unrest from businesses caught in the trade wars and constituents navigating pocketbook issues and high prices.\n\nHouse minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said Trump\u2019s tariffs were \u201ccausing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor months, sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement after the resolution was approved. \u201cToday, House Democrats forced a successful vote to detonate the Trump tariffs on Canada.\u201d\n\nThe high-stakes moment provides a snapshot of the House\u2019s unease with the president\u2019s direction, especially ahead of the midterm elections as economic issues resonate among voters. The Senate has already voted to reject Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada and other countries in a show of displeasure. But both chambers would have to approve the tariff rollbacks, and send the resolution to Trump for the president\u2019s signature \u2013 or veto.\n\nTrump recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada over that country\u2019s proposed China trade deal, intensifying a feud with the longtime US ally and PM Mark Carney.\n\nHouse speaker Mike Johnson tried to prevent the showdown.\n\nJohnson insisted lawmakers wait for a pending supreme court ruling in a lawsuit about the tariffs. He engineered a complicated rules change to prevent floor action. But Johnson\u2019s strategy collapsed late on Tuesday, as Republicans peeled off during a procedural vote to ensure the Democratic measure was able to advance.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s trade policies have been of great benefit,\u201d Johnson had said. \u201cAnd I think the sentiment is that we allow a little more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch.\u201d\n\nLate Tuesday evening, Johnson could be seen speaking to holdout Republican lawmakers as the GOP leadership team struggled to shore up support during a lengthy procedural vote, but the numbers lined up against him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in what the people have done,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House\u2019s national economic council, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday morning. \u201cThe president will make sure they don\u2019t repeal his tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe resolution put forward by Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, would terminate the national emergency that Trump declared a year ago as one of his executive orders.\n\nThe administration claimed illicit drug flow from Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat that allows the president to slap on tariffs on imported goods outside the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\nThe Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, Brian Mast of Florida, said the drug flow of fentanyl into the US is a dire national emergency and the policy must be left in place.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear again about what this resolution is and what it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a debate about tariffs. You can talk about those, but that\u2019s not really what it is,\u201d Mast said. \u201cThis is Democrats trying to ignore that there is a fentanyl crisis.\u201d\n\nExperts say fentanyl produced by cartels in Mexico is largely smuggled into the US from land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the US, but to a much lesser extent.\n\nAhead of voting, some rank-and-file Republican lawmakers expressed unease over the choices ahead as Democrats \u2013 and a few renegade Republicans \u2013 impressed on their colleagues the need to flex their power as the legislative branch rather than ceding so much power to the president to take authority over trade and tariff policy.\n\nDon Bacon of Nebraska said he was unpersuaded by Johnson\u2019s call to wait until the supreme court makes its decision about the legality of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we\u2019re an independent branch?\u201d Bacon said. \u201cWe should defend our authorities. I hope the supreme court does, but if we don\u2019t do it, shame on us.\u201d\n\nBacon, who is retiring rather than facing re-election, also argued that tariffs are bad economic policy.\n\nOther Republicans said they were still making up their minds after Johnson\u2019s gambit \u2013 which would have paused the calendar days to prevent the measure from coming forward \u2013 was turned back.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re going to have to support our president,\u201d said Keith Self of Texas.\n\nDarrell Issa, a California Republican, said he did not want to tie the president\u2019s hands on trade and is ready to support the tariffs on Canada \u201cat this time\u201d."

I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female and identified as female, both socially and publicly.

    "content": "Nine people have been killed and dozens injured after an assailant opened fire at a school in western Canada, in one of the deadliest mass shootings in the country\u2019s history. The suspect was later found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury.\n\nPolice found six people dead inside the high school in the remote town of Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia, with a further two bodies found at a residence believed to be connected to the incident.\n\nAnother person initially believed to have died on the way to hospital was later said to have survived, but remained in critical condition.\n\nThe suspected shooter was found dead at the school, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or an ongoing threat to the public.\n\nPrime minister Mark Carney said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the shootings. \u201cI join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cOur ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country \u2013 our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other.\u201d\n\n1:12 British Columbia school shooting 'one of the worst' in Canada's history, officials say \u2013 video\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said Carney had suspended plans to travel to Germany on Wednesday for the Munich security conference.\n\nMore than two dozen people have been hospitalised \u2013 two with life-threatening injuries \u2013 in what British Columbia\u2019s premier, David Eby, called an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to say on a night like tonight. It\u2019s the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places and not close to home,\u201d Eby told reporters.\n\nA police active-shooter alert sent to people in the area described the suspect as \u201cfemale in a dress with brown hair\u201d. Police Supt Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school. Police did not say how many of the victims were minors.\n\nThe District of Tumbler Ridge issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, calling the shooting a \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d incident for a community of less than 2,500.\n\n1:29 Canadian police give update after deadly school shooting in British Columbia - video\n\n\u201cWe recognise that many residents may be feeling shocked, scared and overwhelmed,\u201d the district said. \u201cIn the days ahead, we know this will be difficult for many to process. Please check in on one another, lean on available supports, and know that Tumbler Ridge is a strong and caring community.\u201d\n\nTumbler Ridge is a remote town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155km northeast of Vancouver.\n\nTumbler Ridge secondary school has 160 students in grades 7 to 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website. The school will be closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said.\n\n\u201cThere are no words that can ease the fear and pain that events like this cause in a school community,\u201d the Tumbler Ridge Parent Advisory Council said in a statement. \u201cWe want families to know that the safety and wellbeing of students and staff are paramount, and we are grateful to the first responders and emergency personnel who acted quickly and professionally.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the town\u2019s small police force was on the scene within two minutes of receiving a call, and that victims were still being assessed hours after the incident. British Columbia\u2019s public safety minister, Nina Krieger, said at a press conference: \u201cSpeed and professionalism saved lives today.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Krieger, said online that news of the shooting was \u201csending shockwaves through the community and the entire province\u201d.\n\nPolice initially issued an emergency active shooter alert on Tuesday afternoon after receiving reports of a shooting at the secondary school at about 1.20pm. The alert told residents to shelter in place, lock their doors and refrain from going outside. The RCMP alert was lifted at 5.45pm.\n\nSupt Floyd told reporters the scene of the shooting was \u201cvery dramatic\u201d with extensive injuries. He said all remaining students and staff at the secondary school, numbering about 100 people, had been safely evacuated from the school.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Google Maps image of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School Photograph: Google Maps\n\nFloyd said police wouldn\u2019t comment on a possible motive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following all leads to try to determine the connection to the shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we will struggle to determine the \u2018why\u2019, but we will try our best to determine what transpired.\u201d\n\nThe town\u2019s health centre was placed on Code Orange, signifying a mass-casualty incident or large-scale emergency response. But given the rural nature of the community, at least two victims were airlifted to larger hospitals. Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service (STARS) said one of its aircraft from Grande Prairie, Alberta, was requested for the incident.\n\nBecause of Canada\u2019s strict gun laws, which make it difficult to own both handguns or \u201cassault-style weapons\u201d, the country has experienced far fewer instances of mass violence compared with the United States. Still, the shooting is the second-deadliest school shooting in Canadian history. In 1989, a gunman killed 14 students at Montreal\u2019s L\u2019Ecole Polytechnique in an attack that targeted women. In 2016, five people were killed in a series in La Loche, Saskatchewan.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Eby, a father of three, said news of the shooting \u201cmakes you want to hug your kids a little tighter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWrap these families with love. Not just tonight but tomorrow and into the future. This is something that will reverberate for years to come,\u201d he said. He later added: \u201cThis is the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places, and not close to home in a way that this feels like for many British Columbians and Canadians.\u201d"

    "content": "An alleged incursion by Mexican cartel drones into US airspace and the sudden closure of El Paso\u2019s airspace has drawn renewed attention to the use of high-powered weapons by organized crime groups in Mexico.\n\nThere were conflicting accounts on Wednesday about whether the city\u2019s airspace was shut down due to cartel drones or a disagreement over the Pentagon testing of counter-drone technology, but experts say the use of drones by drug gangs at the border has become increasingly common.\n\nVeronica Escobar, a Democratic congresswoman representing El Paso said forays by Mexican drug-trafficking groups into American airspace was \u201cnothing new\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been drone incursions from Mexico going back to as long as drones existed,\u201d Escobar said at a news conference.\n\nAs Mexico\u2019s cartels have grown more moneyed and powerful, they have also become increasingly well armed: drug traffickers and hitmen are no longer just wielding pistols and rifles, but also drones that drop bombs, improvised explosive devices, armored vehicles, landmines and grenade launchers.\n\n\u201cThe cartels are preparing for war,\u201d said Eduardo Guerrero, a Mexican security analyst. \u201cThey have a lot of money and the capacity to bring into Mexico a large amount of state-of-the-art weaponry.\u201d\n\nAccording to Guerrero, the cartels have become so well-armed that they have surpassed the capabilities of Mexican authorities, which must go through a complex bureaucratic process to obtain weapons.\n\n\u201cThe criminals are much more up-to-date, much more technologically advanced,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t face any bureaucratic hurdles. They simply bribe officials or bribe vendors, and with money, they get what they want. And they have very advanced weaponry.\u201d\n\nAmong that weaponry, drones have become a key part of the drug gangs\u2019 arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe drone is fundamental,\u201d Guerrero added. \u201cIf you have a good drone strategy, and you can acquire them quickly on the black market, and you combine that with artificial intelligence, forget about it. You become incredibly powerful.\u201d\n\nFirst weaponized in 2017, drones are used by Mexican cartels for reconnaissance, the delivery of drugs and, increasingly, to bomb rivals and sow terror in rural communities, according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on non-state armed groups at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cWe have seen activities by the cartels such as carpet bombing of rural areas in Michoac\u00e1n [state] with the purpose of driving populations out of an area,\u201d said Felab-Brown. \u201cThe reporting in Michoac\u00e1n has been of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people displaced as a result of the scorched-earth policy through drones by [the Jalisco New Generation cartel].\u201d\n\nThe use of drones has also given crime groups a significant advantage in attacking their rivals.\n\n\u201cOn the battlefield one of the big implications is the ability to conduct crime as well as warfare over greater and greater distances,\u201d said Felbab-Brown.\n\nIncreasingly, that long-distance capability of drones has been used by cartels to cross the US-Mexico border.\n\nIn July, Steven Willoughby, director of the counter-drone program at the US Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress saying that cartels were using drones to conduct surveillance and convey drugs across the border \u201cnearly every day\u201d.\n\nIn the last six months of 2024, Willoughby said, more than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters of the southern border. In October, according to Willoughby, customs officials seized a drone carrying 3.6 pounds of fentanyl pills.\n\nMexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, disputed Willoughby\u2019s allegations the next day, saying during her morning news conference that \u201cthere is no information on any new drones currently at the border\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, let\u2019s say, in particular to be alarmed about.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Sheinbaum again rejected claims of a drone incursion in El Paso: \u201cThere is no information regarding drone use at the border,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the FAA or any other US government agency has any information, they can ask the Mexican government.\u201d\n\nBut whether or not there was a drone incursion on US airspace this week, Guerrero warned that, if cartels do use drones to strike targets on US soil, the Trump administration could use it as an excuse to launch its long-threatened ground attack on Mexico to tackle the country\u2019s drug gangs.\n\n\u201cHere in Mexico, cartels have been using drones for some time to attack state and municipal police,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they tried to do something like that in the United States, that would be the perfect pretext for the US to launch a ground offensive against Mexico.\u201d"

He had pleaded not guilty and did not testify at the trial.\n\nView image in fullscreen Anna Kwok said the targeting of her father was an attempt by the authorities \u2018to drive distance between me and other Hongkongers\u2019. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nThe acting principal magistrate Cheng Lim-chi said since Anna Kwok was a fugitive, directly or indirectly handling her insurance policy is illegal.\n\nA sentence is expected to be announced within a few weeks. The maximum penalty is seven years in jail. According to the prosecution, when Kwok Yin-sang was arrested, he said under police caution: \u201cI know my daughter is wanted by the security bureau. I was the one paying for her insurance policy. Since she\u2019s no longer in Hong Kong, I just cut it.\u201d\n\nHe had initially been denied bail but was later granted bail by the high court, with conditions imposed including a travel ban and a ban on communication with his daughter.\n\nDuring the closing submission, his defence lawyer Steven Kwan argued that section 89 and 90 of Article 23 should not apply in a case where a person was simply handling an insurance policy he had bought a long time ago for his children. \u201cThis \u2026 is a form of prosecution based on family ties,\u201d Kwan said.\n\nAnna Kwok\u2019s brother was also arrested for the same crime, and is now on bail.\n\nElaine Pearson, the Asia director for Human Right Watch, said: \u201cThe conviction of Kwok Yin-sang is cruel and vindictive, showing just how far Hong Kong authorities are willing to go to silence peaceful activism abroad.\u201d\n\nThe targeting of relatives of a person wanted by the authorities is common in mainland China, although is a relatively new phenomenon in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous city that was suppose to maintain an independent identity for at least 50 years after it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nView image in fullscreen The 20-year prison sentence handed to Jimmy Lai outstripped the punishments given to some of China\u2019s most famous dissidents. Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nLegal experts and rights groups say the tactics used to target regime critics in Hong Kong are becoming increasingly similar to those of mainland China. On Monday, Jimmy Lai, a high-profile critic of the Chinese Communist party, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for national security offences. The length of the sentence for the 78-year-old outstrips punishments given to some of China\u2019s most famous dissidents.\n\nChina imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020. In 2024, the city\u2019s legislature passed Article 23, enacting a provision of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution that had previously faced fierce opposition from Hongkongers. The authorities said that Article 23 was necessary to close \u201cloopholes\u201d in the city\u2019s national security regime."

    "content": "A Greek air force officer arrested on suspicion of spying for China has been detained pending trial after appearing before a military judge in a case that is seen as exposing Beijing\u2019s determination to infiltrate Europe\u2019s security and intelligence services.\n\nSurrounded by armed escorts, a squadron leader identified as Col Christos Flessas emerged from the court late on Tuesday after giving testimony for more than eight hours.\n\nThe 54-year-old could face a life sentence if found guilty of charges that include \u201ctransmitting top secret information of a military nature\u201d to China. He was described as having access to sensitive military information, including armed forces technologies under development, and is believed to have been recruited by Beijing last year.\n\nGreek media reports said he had admitted to photographing and transmitting classified Nato documents using specialised encryption software provided by Chinese intelligence. He allegedly received tradecraft training in China during an undeclared trip to the country that military sources claimed had ultimately exposed him.\n\nIn a statement made by his lawyer after the court appearance, Flessas said: \u201cUnknowingly and without intent, I became involved in something that developed in a way that became nightmarish, dangerous and illegal. In my testimony I did not try to justify myself or, in reality, even defend myself \u2026 I ask to be punished with a fair punishment.\u201d\n\nGreek authorities were reportedly tipped off by the CIA about the extent of the leak, and in a highly unusual statement after Flessas\u2019s arrest on 5 February the Greek general staff said there was \u201cclear evidence of criminal offences under the military penal code\u201d.\n\nChinese operatives are thought to have initially approached their target online before recruiting him at a Nato conference in an unidentified European country. Flessas has been cited as saying he was lured with promises of financial rewards made in foreign currencies and digital payments of between \u20ac5,000 and \u20ac15,000 for every transmission made. He told the military magistrate on Tuesday that contact with agents that would lead to his handler was first made via LinkedIn.\n\nNicholas Eftimiades, a retired US senior intelligence officer with considerable expertise in Chinese espionage operations, told the Guardian the case was a wake-up call for the Greek government and military.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] significant because it shows China\u2019s desire and ability to penetrate the military communications infrastructure of Greece and other Nato members,\u201d he said. \u201cNations spy against other militaries to give them an advantage in war. Despite all the proclamations of friendship and economic engagement, China continues to evolve as a threat to democracies worldwide.\u201d\n\nFlessas had previously served as a Nato evaluator in information systems and at the time of his arrest was commanding a battalion in the Athenian suburb of Kavouri training in telecommunications.\n\nEftimiades, whose book Chinese Espionage Operations and Tactics was released last year, said because citizens in China were required by law to support their country\u2019s espionage efforts, the west was increasingly vulnerable to Beijing\u2019s spymasters.\n\nLast week, four people including two Chinese nationals were arrested in France on suspicion of intercepting and collecting military intelligence. In Germany last September, a former aide to a member of parliament for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party was sentenced to almost five years in prison for spying on behalf of China.\n\n\u201cChina uses a \u2018whole of society\u2019 approach to conduct worldwide espionage,\u201d said Eftimiades, who now teaches homeland security at Penn State University. \u201c[It] is unlike the efforts of any western government. The sheer volume of activity makes it impossible to counter \u2026 western societies are open democracies. This makes them extremely vulnerable to China\u2019s covert influence efforts.\u201d\n\nMedia reports on Tuesday suggested the Hellenic air force officer was cooperating fully with authorities. Well-placed insiders said there were fears of other military officials being implicated. One said the armed forces were airing the case so publicly as a warning.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is unprecedented,\u201d said Plamen Tonchev, an expert in Sino-Greek affairs. \u201cGreece is seen as a relatively China-friendly country. This is the very first time that China is so openly implicated in an espionage case of this kind.\u201d\n\nTonchev said the episode was bound \u201cto tarnish the image\u201d of Beijing in a country where it had acquired control of much of the port of Piraeus a decade ago.\n\nAn estimated 24% of imports to Europe from China are shipped through Piraeus\u2019s container terminals, and Tonchev said this was a source of \u201cgreat pride\u201d for Beijing."

    "content": "Hong Kong\u2019s once-vibrant media outlets have responded with silence or celebration to the 20-year jail sentence handed down to Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy media tycoon and critic of the Chinese Communist party.\n\nLai, 78, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison after being convicted of sedition and colluding with foreign forces under Hong Kong\u2019s national security law. The charges were widely seen as being politically motivated and designed to silence one of Hong Kong\u2019s most influential pro-democracy campaigners.\n\nLai is the founder of Apple Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that was forced to close in 2021 amid a crackdown on dissent in the Hong Kong. After months of protests, which Lai and his newspaper supported, Beijing imposed a national security law on the city. Lai was one of the earliest, and most high-profile, people to be arrested under the new legislation.\n\nThe US, the UK, the EU and the UN have condemned the heavy sentence handed down to Lai, a British citizen, and called for his release. Lai\u2019s sentence is the harshest meted out under the national security law and is longer than the punishments given to mainland China\u2019s most well-known dissidents.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jimmy Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that was forced to close in 2021. Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s press associations, once the voices of media freedom in the city, reacted with silence, underscoring the narrowing space for commentary that could be seen as critical of the authorities.\n\nSelina Cheng, the chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), said: \u201cI\u2019m not free to speak my mind on the Apple Daily sentencing.\u201d\n\nThe HKJA has been attacked before by the Hong Kong government for \u201cwhitewashing\u201d Lai, and the association and Cheng personally have also been targeted by Chinese state media.\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong (FCC) said it had no comment about the heavy sentence given to one of Hong Kong\u2019s most influential media figures.\n\n7:19 Jimmy Lai: will Hong Kong media tycoon die in jail? | The Latest\n\nMike Bird, a journalist for The Economist, wrote on X: \u201cI am so glad in retrospect that I never joined the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, an organisation that has repeatedly disgraced itself over the past half a decade in exchange for a cheap bar.\u201d\n\nThe FCC did not respond to an immediate request for comment about that characterisation.\n\nAn analysis by Hong Kong Free Press, a local outlet, showed that the number of statements issued by the FCC in support of press freedom has declined dramatically since the imposition of the national security law.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s three other press associations, the Beijing-backed Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, the Hong Kong News Executives Association and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association also did not publish statements about Lai\u2019s sentence.\n\nRonson Chan, a former chair of the HKJA, said: \u201cIt\u2019s abnormal for these five associations [to have] no response to Jimmy Lai\u2019s case, whether they support or regret the sentencing\u201d. Chan said it was a \u201cmanipulation by the authority\u201d to \u201cdisconnect the sentencing\u201d from press freedom issues.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s local media outlets, however, generally celebrated the sentence given to Lai and his co-defendants, who include six former executives from Lai\u2019s media company.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, which is owned by the Chinese tech company Alibaba, published an editorial arguing that Lai\u2019s case shows that the rule of law remains \u201crobust\u201d in Hong Kong and that the sentence reflects \u201cthe gravity of his crimes\u201d.\n\nHK01, a pro-Beijing outlet, also praised the sentencing and said that it \u201cmarks the end of that politically chaotic period\u201d.\n\nTa Kung Pao, a state-owned newspaper, said: \u201cThe anti-China and pro-chaos forces represented by Jimmy Lai have been forever nailed to the pillar of historical shame.\u201d\n\nAleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager for Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said: \u201cSince the enactment of the national security law, media organisations and journalists in Hong Kong have faced unprecedented pressure from the authorities. In addition to judicial harassment, they are subjected to surveillance, threats, doxing, and online abuse, while foreign reporters are increasingly denied entry \u2026 Hong Kong no longer provides space for critical voices.\u201d\n\nBeh Lih Yi, the Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \u201cWe need to be clear-eyed: it is the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities that have created a repressive climate of fear. Five years since the Beijing-imposed national security law, Hong Kong\u2019s once-vibrant free press is a ghost of its former self.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has plummeted down RSF\u2019s press freedom index in recent years, now ranking 140th out of 180 territories surveyed.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s State Council, the highest organ of government, published a white paper on Tuesday titled: \u201cHong Kong: Safeguarding China\u2019s National Security Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems.\u201d\n\nThe policy document detailed the \u201cunrelenting fight\u201d for national security in Hong Kong and underscored the authority of the central government in Beijing.\n\nThe paper said that the Beijing\u2019s rule in Hong Kong \u201cserves China\u2019s fundamental interests, benefits the residents of Hong Kong, and meets the interests of external investors\u201d.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has been contacted for comment.\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang"

    "content": "Federal judges have dismissed three lawsuits accusing the bestselling fantasy author Neil Gaiman of sexually assaulting his children\u2019s nanny in New Zealand four years ago.\n\nScarlett Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaiman and his wife, Amanda Palmer, in Wisconsin in February 2025, accusing Gaiman of multiple sexual assaults while she worked as the family\u2019s nanny in 2022. She filed lawsuits against Palmer in Massachusetts and in New York on the same day she filed the Wisconsin action.\n\nGaiman has a home in north-western Wisconsin, and Palmer lives in Massachusetts. Pavlovich moved to drop the New York lawsuit against Palmer in May, explaining in court documents that she filed an action in that state because Palmer had recently relocated from New York to Massachusetts and she was unsure which state had jurisdiction. US district judge Mary Kay Vyskocil in New York granted the request in June.\n\nPavlovich also dropped the portion of the Wisconsin lawsuit against Palmer in May, and US district judge James Peterson in Madison dismissed the rest of it in October, saying Pavlovich needed to pursue the case in New Zealand. US district judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston threw out the Massachusetts filing on Friday on the same grounds.\n\nPavlovich\u2019s attorneys did not respond to emails from the Associated Press seeking comment on Monday. Attorneys listed for Gaiman and Palmer did not respond to messages, either.\n\nThe AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York magazine, which published an article in January 2025 detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.\n\nPavlovich alleged in her lawsuits that she was 22 and homeless when she met Palmer in Auckland in 2020. Palmer invited Pavlovich to the couple\u2019s Waiheke Island home, and she eventually became their son\u2019s nanny, according to the filings.\n\nPavlovich alleged in the lawsuits that Gaiman sexually assaulted her on the night they met in February 2022. The assaults continued, according to the filings, but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless, and Gaiman had told her that he would help her writing career.\n\nWhen she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits. The assaults finally stopped when Pavlovich told Palmer that she was going to kill herself, according to the filings.\n\nPavlovich went on to allege that Palmer knew of Gaiman\u2019s sexual desires and presented her to him, knowing he would assault her. She argued that Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and demanded at least $7m in damages\n\nGaiman released a statement after the New York magazine article was published, denying he had ever sexually abused anyone.\n\nGaiman\u2019s attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss the Wisconsin lawsuit that Gaiman and Pavlovich had a brief personal relationship that involved \u201cconsensual physical intimacy\u201d.\n\nPolice in New Zealand investigated her assault allegations and found them meritless, the motion says. The attorneys went on to argue that Pavlovich\u2019s lawsuits were the culmination of a plan to smear Gaiman and that any legal disputes should be resolved in New Zealand, not the US.\n\nGaiman has authored numerous science fiction and fantasy works, including the novels American Gods, The Graveyard Book, Anansi Boys and the children\u2019s dark fairy tale, Coraline.\n\nHis 2013 novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, won the National Book award in Britain."

The South Australian senator posted on social media on Thursday afternoon, saying she respected Ley but planned to vote for Angus Taylor in Friday\u2019s spill. Matters are coming to a head. My concerns are not about personalities. They are about direction. Australians are anxious. Families are under pressure. Living standards are going backwards. Interest rates remain high and household budgets are stretched. Blyth said the country needed a strong, disciplined and credible opposition.

I believe many Australians would have found those scenes confronting, and I think it would have been particularly confronting for Muslim Australians. I found them confronting. I would say that freedom of religion and the peaceful expression of different views is a core part of who we are. Video shot at a protest in Sydney on Monday night showed about a dozen men, led by sheikh Wesam Charkawi, kneeling in prayer in two straight lines in the forecourt of Sydney town hall.

On Wednesday, Kefah Maradweh told ABC Radio Sydney she planned to press charges after her son, Nedal, alleged police pushed him to the ground, kicked him and restrained him before he was released without charge during a protest. Nedal said yesterday: They grabbed me by my keffiyeh, my scarf, and just dragged me, pulled me, kicked me on the floor, knee to my head, knee to my neck, and then put me in handcuffs. Youth Action says any action where a young person is allegedly harmed in a public space should prompt \u201cserious reflection about how we protect the safety and rights of children and young people in our community\u201d, calling for an independent review. The group\u2019s CEO, Lauren Stracey, said in a statement: Young people have the right to participate in civic life, express their views and be heard. They also have the right to safety. These rights are not conditional, and one does not cancel out the other. All institutions, including the NSW Police, have responsibility to prioritise the safety and wellbeing of children and young people in every interaction. The use of force against a young person raises serious concerns about how that responsibility is being upheld.

    "content": "The Liberal party is on the brink of dumping its first female leader, with Angus Taylor\u2019s backers confident of defeating Sussan Ley in Friday\u2019s leadership vote.\n\nThe embattled opposition leader faced a tide of 10 resignations by 7pm on Thursday, with frontbenchers including Dan Tehan, Michaelia Cash, Jonathon Duniam, James McGrath and Dean Smith all abandoning Ley to vote for Taylor.\n\nBoth sides agreed a handful of votes could decide whether a party room spill motion succeeds after 9am on Friday, but Ley\u2019s supporters faced being outgunned by conservatives building support for a change in the party\u2019s presentation and policy direction.\n\nTaylor sensationally quit the frontbench on Wednesday night, posting a video to social media on Thursday morning announcing his long anticipated bid for the leadership.\n\nApart from a series of social media posts, Ley remained silent about the challenge, but agreed to demands from MPs for a special party room meeting to facilitate the vote.\n\nHer deputy, Ted O\u2019Brien, faces a fight to keep his job, with the Victorian senator Jane Hume and frontbencher Dan Tehan expected to nominate. The former environment minister Melissa Price also confirmed she would run for deputy.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation, Tehan warned the Liberals faced a wipeout without change.\n\n\u201cWe need to immediately unify, hold this dreadful Albanese Labor government to account, develop a policy manifesto true to our values, and make us match-fit to win elections,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nMcGrath\u2019s move to the backbench was a blow to Ley\u2019s position, with the Queensland senator and former party strategist considered one of her key backers in the party room.\n\nHe said change was in the best interest of the country, his home state and the Coalition.\n\n\u201cWhile I realise this news won\u2019t please everyone, it is important that Australia has a strong and effective opposition.\u201d\n\nLey led a muted question time attack on Labor and participated in anniversary commemorations for the Rudd government\u2019s national apology to the Stolen Generations. Labor turned its guns on Taylor, and lashed the Liberal party for infighting as parliament considered the latest Closing the Gap report on Indigenous disadvantage.\n\nIn order for the spill motion to succeed, half of the 52-person party room will have to vote to vacate the leadership.\n\nIn that event, Ley could opt to follow previous leaders and not to contest the subsequent ballot for leader, recognition of the spill as an effective vote of no confidence in her nine months at the top. That scenario could see Taylor elected unopposed.\n\nIf she is rolled, Ley will be the second shortest serving Liberal leader, ahead of only Alexander Downer\u2019s troubled tenure in the 1990s.\n\nThere was speculation Ley could look to immediately quit politics if she is dumped, setting up a difficult byelection for the newly installed Taylor in a country seat.\n\nLey\u2019s support included frontbenchers Andrew Wallace, Julian Leeser, Paul Scarr and Andrew Bragg.\n\nTaylor had broader support, including the nine MPs who resigned the frontbench, and conservatives including Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Tony Pasin, Jess Collins, Alex Antic, Ben Small and Sarah Henderson.\n\nPaterson said he would stop the party\u2019s haemorrhaging of support, including to One Nation.\n\n\u201cAngus is the smartest policy brain in the shadow cabinet, a man of courage and values,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd most importantly, Angus understands this is a change or die moment for the Liberal party.\u201d\n\nKey votes including the New South Wales senator Dave Sharma, up and coming rightwinger Simon Kennedy and conservative Cameron Caldwell were yet to declare their support.\n\nLiberals were increasingly confident of the likely result on Thursday evening, with one telling Guardian Australia \u201cit\u2019s done\u201d.\n\nIf Hume is elevated to deputy leader, she could replace Cash, the shadow foreign affairs minister, as the Coalition\u2019s Senate leader, firming up any risk to her preselection and leapfrogging Paterson in the upper house leadership.\n\nConservatives demanded the new leader move more quickly to announce key policies, including on cost-of-living and immigration, criticising Ley\u2019s approach while bogged down on fights about net zero and damaging splits with the Nationals."

    "content": "The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has raised the issue of Australian war graves bulldozed by the Israeli military in Gaza directly with the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.\n\nDozens of Australian war graves \u2013 mostly soldiers who died in Palestine during the second world war \u2013 were bulldozed by the Israel Defense Forces across April and May last year. Satellite images show the southern corner of the Gaza Commonwealth War Cemetery being obliterated, with headstones destroyed and soil pushed by machinery into an earthen berm.\n\nThe majority of graves in that corner of the cemetery \u2013 sections A and B \u2013 hold the remains of Australian soldiers.\n\nAfter Guardian reporting last week, the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv raised the issue with both the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs and its defence ministry.\n\nThis week, the prime minister directly raised the issue with Herzog during meetings in Canberra, impressing upon the president the importance of repairs being conducted as soon as possible. The Australian government has confirmed its nationals\u2019 graves will be restored when it is safe to do so.\n\nAsked about the desecration of Australian graves in Gaza, Penny Wong told Senate estimates: \u201cAll of the graves and places where Australians have fallen and are interred have great significance for our country, particularly for the Australian veterans community, but for all of us.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of great importance to the government, it is a matter of great importance to the veterans community, and we have been clear with Israel about the importance these graves hold for Australians.\u201d\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nWilma Spence\u2019s father, Albert Kemp, a decorated Anzac who died in Palestine in the second world war, is buried at the cemetery.\n\nIn a moving interview on the weekend, Spence told Guardian Australia of her family\u2019s grief and shock at learning of the destruction of her father\u2019s grave.\n\nSpence said she still hadn\u2019t received any information from the Australian government about her father\u2019s grave, and was told by the Australian War Graves Commission that it could not discuss individual graves with her.\n\nShe wanted to know whether the prime minister asked Herzog to pay for the cemetery\u2019s restoration, and questioned why the government was not stronger in condemning the destruction.\n\n\u201cI just think why are they not saying anything \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s getting me,\u201d Spence said. \u201cWhere are the press releases? Why didn\u2019t they say anything as soon as they found out?\u201d\n\nIndependent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, raised the issue in Senate estimates, and told the Guardian it was \u201cunacceptable that the IDF has bulldozed Australian war graves in Gaza\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also concerned by the apparent timidity of the government to hold the Israeli government to account and to call on them to fully fund the restoration. Why should the Commonwealth War Graves Commission be responsible for restoration?\n\n\u201cWhen you look at satellite imagery, and the witness accounts, it seems clear that the cemetery has been bulldozed, but we still don\u2019t have the full picture on the extent to which the graves have been disturbed.\u201d\n\nPocock said the Australians\u2019 war graves were sacred places.\n\n\u201cAnd I think there is an expectation that when they are desecrated, we use every tool at our disposal to hold those responsible to account,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tuffah area of Gaza City, in which the cemetery sits, has been shelled throughout the current conflict. But more systematic and extensive damage was caused by military earthmoving in April and May of last year.\n\nEssam Jarada, Gaza cemetery\u2019s former caretaker, whose home is also close by, said two bulldozing operations took place at the cemetery in April and May 2025.\n\n\u201cAn area of slightly less than one dunum [1,000 sq metres] was bulldozed inside the cemetery walls, specifically in the corner of the cemetery which contains graves of Australian soldiers. The bulldozing covered the area from the bench where foreign visitors used to sit up to the memorial monument. Bulldozers also created sand mounds that were used as earth barriers,\u201d Jarada said.\n\n\u201cI witnessed this bulldozing after the Israeli army withdrew from the area, around late April or early May.\u201d\n\nAfter being shown satellite images of the cemetery, the IDF said that it had been forced to take defensive measures during military operations.\n\n\u201cDuring IDF operations in the area, terrorists attempted to attack IDF troops and took cover in structures close to the cemetery. In response to ensure the safety of IDF troops operating on the ground, operational measures were taken in the area to neutralize identified threats.\u201d\n\nIn response to a series of questions, a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs told the Guardian there had been \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the Gaza War Cemetery, \u201cand this includes the graves of Australians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Office of Australian War Graves is very concerned by the damage to the cemetery,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission plans to secure and repair the cemetery as soon as it is safe to do so, however, it is expected that full reconstruction will take some time as the immediate post-conflict priority for works will be directed to humanitarian efforts.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has sought comment from the office of the Israeli president."

And I\u2019d like to think that today reaffirms that overwhelmingly,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nDalton told Howe on Tuesday: \u201cMy regret is that I didn\u2019t stand up earlier, OK, and I asked God for forgiveness for that; I should have stood up in the campaign.\n\n\u201cI stood in press conferences in Mackay, alongside other members who are now in the government, and we said there would be no change, no change to the abortion laws. There probably won\u2019t be any changes. But I didn\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral LNP MPs were quoted during the election campaign promising changes to the state\u2019s abortion laws. Numerous members of the Crisafulli government voted against the bill legalising it in 2018, and others have professed strong views against abortion.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s question time Labor levelled an attack on LNP assistant minister Amanda Stoker, tabling a document with claims about the Oodgeroo MP.\n\nIn the video, the CEO of anti-abortion group Cherish Life, Matt Cliff, claims Stoker told him \u201cmaybe we can do it next term\u201d, referring to changing Queensland\u2019s abortion laws.\n\nIn a statement Stoker said: \u201cI did not commit to any position on behalf of the government and there will be no change to the laws\u201d."

    "published_at": "Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:38:59 GMT",
    "content": "EU leaders are expected to diverge on whether \u201cBuy European\u201d is an answer to Europe\u2019s waning economic fortunes, at a summit on how to secure the continent\u2019s future in a more volatile global economy.\n\nAt a moated castle in the east Belgian countryside, the EU\u2019s 27 leaders will gather on Thursday for a brainstorming session on how Europe can regain its economic competitiveness vis-a-vis the US and China, at a time of economic threats and political turbulence.\n\nArriving at the summit on Thursday, the European Council president, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, said: \u201cWe have a clear priority to strengthen economic growth in Europe. That is essential to our prosperity, to create quality jobs, and to sustain our economic social model.\u201d\n\nThe question of Europe\u2019s declining competitiveness has long troubled the EU, but gained new urgency when painful vulnerabilities were revealed by the sudden loss of Russian gas in 2022, Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and China\u2019s pursuit of economic dominance via huge state subsidies.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the EU is considering the once-taboo policy of European preference, namely favouring European companies in strategic sectors such as clean tech. Long promoted by France, Buy European could mean imposing requirements on governments to prioritise locally manufactured goods in public contracts.\n\nLater this month, the EU executive will publish an Industrial Accelerator Act, which is expected to set targets for European content in a range of strategic products, such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, told European newspapers this week that European preference should be focused on certain strategic sectors, such as clean technologies, chemicals, steel, automotive and defence \u201cotherwise Europeans will be swept aside\u201d.\n\nHe described European preference as \u201ca defensive measure\u201d and essential because \u201cwe are facing unfair competitors who no longer respect the rules of the World Trade Organization\u201d.\n\nA group of northern European countries that champion free trade have fired a warning shot against the idea. A joint paper from the Nordics, Baltics and the Netherlands stated that European preference \u201ccould risk adding another layer of complex regulation\u201d and push away investment.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Mich\u00e9al Martin, said: \u201cWe must protect the open free trade ethos of the European Union in my view. And so there will be debates around that.\u201d\n\nSweden\u2019s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said he was wary of any protectionist agenda. \u201cThe basic idea of trying to protect European business, if that is the purpose of Buy European, to try to avoid trading with or partner with other countries, then I\u2019m very sceptical,\u201d he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, skirted the issue in a recent joint paper but found common ground on \u201clegislative self-restraint\u201d, or less EU regulation. Both would like the EU\u2019s deregulation agenda to go further.\n\nThe flourishing German-Italian partnership has raised questions about the health of the Franco-German relationship, the traditional motor of the European project.\n\nDespite a rapprochement in Franco-German relations since Merz\u2019s election, Paris and Berlin diverge on key economic questions. Merz is sceptical about the Buy European concept, favouring a more aggressive deregulation agenda and trade deals. Merz and Macron also disagree on the EU\u2019s long-sought trade deal with Mercosur. While the German leader has called for speedy entry into force of the agreement with South American countries, Macron dismissed it as \u201ca bad deal\u201d.\n\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, sounded a cautious note about Buy European. Speaking in the European parliament on Wednesday, she said European preference was \u201ca necessary instrument\u201d in strategic sectors. \u201cBut I want to be clear \u2013 it is a fine line to walk,\u201d she said, adding every proposal must be \u201cunderpinned by robust economic analysis and be in line with our international obligations\u201d.\n\nThe Buy European question is only one part of a sprawling summit agenda taking place at Alden Biesen in Limburg, an estate founded in the 13th century by Teutonic knights. Leaders will also discuss deregulation, fragmented capital markets that constrain green and digital investment, as well as barriers in the European single market that hamper trade.\n\nVon der Leyen told MEPs there was \u201ctoo much gold-plating\u201d \u2013 extra layers of national regulation that make life harder for business. As an example, she said a truck in Belgium was allowed to weigh 44 tonnes but could carry only 40 tonnes when it crosses into France.\n\nThe leaders will hear from Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta, two former Italian prime ministers, who produced agenda-setting reports on the economy. Draghi warned last week that the current economic world order was \u201cdead\u201d and Europe risked becoming \u201csubordinated, divided and deindustrialised at once\u201d.\n\nHe said Europe needed to move from \u201cconfederation to federation\u201d, adding that veto power for individual member states in key policies made countries \u201cvulnerable to being picked off one by one\u201d.\n\nAcknowledging the EU\u2019s difficulties in taking decisions, von der Leyen said she was open to moving ahead with passing laws on integrating the EU\u2019s capital markets in a smaller formation, if there was no agreement at 27.\n\n\u201cWe have to make progress and tear down the barriers that prevent us from being a true global giant,\u201d she said, referencing plans for integrating the European financial system."

    "content": "Switzerland will vote this summer on a proposal from the far-right Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP) to limit the country\u2019s population to 10 million, a move that would threaten key agreements with the EU and, opponents say, cripple the economy.\n\nThe government said on Wednesday the referendum on the SVP\u2019s \u201cNo to a 10 million Switzerland\u201d initiative, which is strongly opposed by both chambers of parliament and the business and financial services community, would be held on 10 June.\n\nThe initiative would oblige the Swiss government and parliament to act if the country\u2019s permanent population, currently 9.1 million, exceeds 9.5 million by denying entrance to newcomers, including asylum seekers and the families of foreign residents.\n\nIf the population reaches 10 million, further restrictions would come into force, and if numbers do not start to fall the government would be required to pull out of the free-movement agreement it has with the EU, by far its biggest export market.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s population has grown about five times faster than the average in surrounding EU member states over the past decade, as its economic success has attracted both low-skilled workers and highly paid corporate expats.\n\nAbout 27% of Swiss residents are not citizens, according to government figures. The SVP, the country\u2019s largest political party, says the \u201cpopulation explosion\u201d is inflating rents and straining public infrastructure and services to breaking point.\n\nThe party, which has finished first in every election since 1999, has long campaigned against immigration, highlighting crimes committed by foreigners and posting images of bloody knives, hooded criminals, fists and frightened women.\n\nThe radical nationalist changes it frequently proposes, such as a 2016 proposal to automatically deport immigrants found guilty of even minor offences, and a 2020 plan to end free movement with the EU, have not generally fared so well.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s system of direct democracy allows citizens to propose so-called popular initiatives that are put to a plebiscite if they get 100,000 backers in 18 months. They are a long-favoured tool of the SVP, but only about 10% of popular initiatives pass.\n\nHowever, a poll in December revealed broad support from 48% of voters for the \u201cNo to a 10 million Switzerland\u201d initiative, reflecting deeply divided sentiment about how open the country wants and needs to be in a fast-changing world.\n\nOpponents, including multinationals such as Roche, UBS and Nestl\u00e9, say the proposal would jeopardise the bilateral agreements with the EU, including a deal reached last year over single market access, on which much of Switzerland\u2019s prosperity rests.\n\nEconomiesuisse, a leading business lobby, has described it as the \u201cchaos initiative\u201d and warned that many Swiss companies rely on EU and other European workers, without whom they will have to relocate abroad, hitting tax revenue and services.\n\nRival parties have said a close relationship with Europe is Switzerland\u2019s only option: about half of all the country\u2019s exports go to the EU. Employers\u2019 associations have said the population will increase mainly through natural growth and longer life expectancy."

We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.\u201d\n\nThe move fits into the Kremlin\u2019s aim to achieve a \u201csovereign internet\u201d \u2013 an online space cut off from western technology and foreign influence, and more vulnerable to state control.\n\nThe latest rift between Russia and WhatsApp comes amid a broader crackdown on social media, most recently targeting Telegram, another popular messaging app used by more than 60 million Russians each day. The move triggered criticism from frontline Russian troops, as well as pro-war bloggers and exiled opposition figures.\n\nAfter users reported slower traffic and delays in downloading videos and images on Tuesday, Telegram\u2019s Russian-born billionaire founder, Pavel Durov \u2013 who is based in Dubai \u2013 criticised Russian authorities. \u201cRestricting citizens\u2019 freedom is never the right answer,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cTelegram stands for freedom of speech and privacy, no matter the pressure.\u201d\n\nThe Russian state-sponsored app, Max, is largely modelled on China\u2019s own \u201csuper app\u201d WeChat and has approximately 55 million users across Russia. In August last year, Russia ordered Max be pre-installed on new phones, with critics arguing that the app could be used to surveil users, a claim dismissed in state media as false.\n\nOwned by Meta, WhatsApp reportedly has at least 100 million users in Russia, making it the country\u2019s most widely used messaging service, according to the Financial Times, which previously reported that Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory operated by Roskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s media monitoring agency.\n\nThe outlet added that Russian authorities also removed Facebook and Instagram \u2013 both also owned by Meta \u2013 from the directory.\n\nIn December last year, Russian authorities blocked access to Snapchat and also placed restrictions on FaceTime, Apple\u2019s own video calling service.\n\nWhen asked if WhatsApp would return in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency Tass in a video published on Wednesday: \u201cThis is again a question of fulfilling the legislation. If the Meta corporation fulfils this and enters into dialogue with Russian authorities, then we have the possibility of reaching an agreement.\u201d\n\nPeskov added: \u201cIf the corporation [Meta] sticks to an uncompromising position and, I would say, shows itself unready to align with Russian legislation, then there is no chance.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kremlin for additional comment."

    "published_at": "Wed, 11 Feb 2026 20:06:32 GMT",
    "content": "The son of Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian prisoner often described as the Nelson Mandela of the Palestinian movement, has called on the British government to put his father\u2019s release at the heart of Palestinian democratic renewal.\n\nArab Barghouti warned the UK government that its recent recognition of a Palestinian state risks providing nothing but false hope unless it follows through by using diplomatic channels to secure his father\u2019s freedom.\n\n\u201cSimply saying \u2018we support a two-state solution\u2019 without doing anything about it is deepening the problem, because you are just giving the Palestinian people false hopes,\u201d he said.\n\nBarghouti also insisted that nothing in law would prevent his father from standing in the Palestinian parliamentary elections due on 1 November, even if the Israelis keep him in jail.\n\nA cross-party group of British MPs have been campaigning for the release of Barghouti, arguing he is a unifying figure who can hasten a two-state solution, the peaceful political outcome he has championed from inside jail. Successive opinion polls have shown he remains the most popular candidate to become president of the Palestinian Authority in succession to Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nThe Foreign Office has so far declined to back the calls for his release.\n\nBarghouti, a member of the Fatah party central committee, has been held in jail for 22 years after being given multiple life sentences in September 2003 for five murders, at a trial that a lengthy Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) inquiry found failed to meet the standards of fairness. Barghouti, during the second intifada, said he opposed the targeting of civilians inside Israel, but defended the right to resist the occupation.\n\nIsrael has released more than 500 Palestinians serving life sentences in the last 15 years, but has always excluded Barghouti. His son warned a meeting in London: \u201cThe UK recognition of Palestine is going to be seen as symbolic in the history books as long as there are no actual steps being taken on the ground.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cCurrent Palestinian politics is dysfunctional and that can only be changed with democratic renewal, including a new leadership that really represents the people. We have not had elections for 20 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father does not have a magic stick, he cannot change everything overnight, but people look at my father as a source of hope,\u201d he said.\n\nBarghouti said his father, freed from jail, would be in a position to sell any agreement to Palestinians, and so represented the best route to a non-violent solution, adding: \u201cThe reason he is not being released is because the Israeli government does not want a legitimate Palestinian leader, because it does not want a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nHe said his father has been kept in solitary confinement since the 7 October attack on Israel and has been assaulted multiple times, most recently in October, leading to broken ribs. He said: \u201cIf that is not an invitation to speak out against the violations of international law, I don\u2019t know what is. I would expect the UK government, as an upholder of international law, to go further and call for his release. He can change the status quo, Palestinian politics, and take us on a path to where there is real hope for a political settlement.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet had brave enough British politicians when it comes to the highest level of politics.\u201d\n\nLabour MPs said there is a growing sense of frustration that the UK government has sat back after the recognition of Palestine, and that France and Spain have been more proactive.\n\nAsked if the UK supports Barghouti\u2019s release, the Foreign Office in written answers states it supports the International Committee of the Red Cross having access to Palestinian prisoners.\n\nWith some MPs reluctant to back Barghouti on the basis that he was found guilty by an Israeli court of organising the murder of four Israelis, and one Greek monk, the Barghouti campaign has been working to reassure MPs about his innocence and the many flaws in the Israeli judicial process.\n\nThe author of the 2003 IPU inquiry, Simon Henderson, told the Westminster meeting he compiled his highly critical report after full conversations with the Israeli attorney general. He said he discovered that, of the 96 witnesses, only 21 were in a position to testify to his involvement, and yet none did so, while 12 of them explicitly exonerated him. Israel claims that at the time of the second intifada Barghouti helped found the armed wing of Fatah, and that the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade had claimed him as its leader."

On Tuesday, Donald Trump said he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East to prepare for military action if talks with Tehran failed.\n\nPezeshkian said Iran was willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme and was \u201cready for any kind of verification\u201d in relation to its insistence it is not trying to build nuclear weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran\u2019s nuclear stockpile.\n\nPezeshkian said: \u201cThe high wall of mistrust that the United States and Europe have created through their past statements and actions does not allow these talks to reach a conclusion.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we are engaging with full determination in dialogue aimed at peace and stability in the region alongside our neighbouring countries.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Masoud Pezeshkian did not directly address the protests that rocked the country at the beginning of the year but said authorities were \u2018ready to hear the voice of the people\u2019.

We are obliged to serve all those who were harmed in this process. We are ready to hear the voice of the people. We are servants of the people and we do not seek to confront the people.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pezeshkian spurned an appeal from leaders of reformist parties to speak out against the mass arrest of their leadership in recent days. In a statement, the Reform Front told Pezeshkian that a failure to demand their release would be understood as a betrayal of his campaign promises and a blow to peace.\n\nLawyers acting for the detained reformists said they understood they were being kept in solitary confinement. Media organisations close to the security forces claimed they were guilty of sedition by trying to organise a national conference to call for change.\n\nView image in fullscreen Demonstrations at the beginning of the year roiled the country and triggered an unprecedented crisis for the regime.

A teachers\u2019 union said it believed 213 children were killed.\n\nOther regime figures used the anniversary of the revolution as an opportunity to reassert their ideological supremacy.\n\nBrig gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, the defence minister, hailed the crowds as unique and claimed: \u201cI have never seen such a passionate attendance in any year.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThey have participated in this march with full awareness, and this presence is more powerful than any bomb or missile.\u201d\n\nAway from the demonstrations, Iranian diplomats were trying to head off an attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu to toughen Trump\u2019s negotiating stance with Iran before the Israeli leader\u2019s meeting in the White House with him on Wednesday.\n\nView image in fullscreen The 1979 commemorations featured state television showing hundreds of thousands of people at pro-government rallies.

Tehran is determined that its stockpile of ballistic missiles, regarded as necessary for Iran\u2019s defence, is excluded from the talks. Ali Shamkhani, a representative of the supreme leader, said the missile issue was not something that the negotiators had authority over.\n\nIn his latest remarks, Trump suggested Iran\u2019s nuclear missiles would have to be included in any agreement.\n\nAli Larijani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s supreme national security council, visited Qatar after holding three hours of talks with mediators in Oman on Tuesday. Larijani is trying to craft a response to US demands that will keep within Iran\u2019s red lines but still make the US believe talks are worth continuing.\n\nLarijani kept open the possibility of wider talks with US, so long as next week\u2019s talks are confined to guarantees about Iran\u2019s civil nuclear programme.\n\nLarijani said: \u201cIf the current negotiations with the United States are successful, they can be expanded and extended to other areas as well. However, at the moment, I cannot say definitively whether this path will lead to talks about other disputes with the United States or not.\u201d"

In its World Cup bid, Saudi Arabia promised to build 11 new stadiums and renovate four for the 2034 tournament.\n\nArshad died on 12 March 2025, while working on a high platform at Aramco Stadium in the eastern city of Al Khobar. The platform tilted suddenly, and Arshad, who was not secured to it, was thrown to the ground. He later died in hospital, leaving behind his wife and three young sons in Pakistan.\n\nUnder Saudi law, Arshad\u2019s family are entitled to be paid compensation for his death, potentially worth as much as \u00a363,250. They are also entitled to his outstanding salary and end-of-service benefits.\n\n\n\nHis family, who live in the district of Mansehra, about two hours\u2019 drive north of Islamabad, say the only money they have received has come from a voluntary donation from Arshad\u2019s co-workers and stakeholders working on the project, matched funded by Besix.\n\nIn response to a request to comment, Besix told the Guardian that end-of-service benefits had been transferred to the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation and should be paid shortly once the family had submitted the required documents. The company said it was also in contact with the family and that they were being assisted on completing the necessary documents for the insurance payment \u2013 death compensation \u2013 to be made.\n\nSardar Manzoor, a local politician and friend of Arshad, says the family should not be waiting so long to be compensated. \u201cArshad was like my brother, so I don\u2019t want his children to suffer.\u201d He says many people from the area go to work in the Gulf. \u201cTwo or three from every family. It\u2019s only their remittances that keep the economy afloat.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s lengthy delay appears to show how difficult it is for families of migrant workers who die in Saudi Arabia to negotiate the bureaucratic process to secure compensation, or even know what they are entitled to.\n\n\u201cThis terrible case is sadly emblematic of what so many families of migrant workers who die in Saudi Arabia go through. It shows the enormous hurdles that they face in attempting to secure the compensation they are legally due in cases of workplace accidents,\u201d said James Lynch, a director of human rights group FairSquare.\n\nHuman rights groups have previously highlighted the \u201clong and burdensome\u201d process families faced to get compensation and have documented a number of cases where families received little or no compensation.\n\nLynch urged Fifa to publicly demand compensation for the families of workers who have died on projects linked to the tournament, saying: \u201cFifa has recklessly awarded the World Cup to Saudi Arabia after a sham human rights assessment process. That means they cannot escape their responsibility for the massive construction programme that will result.\u201d"

    "content": "Israeli measures to tighten its control of the West Bank have prompted a global backlash, including a signal from Washington restating the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to annexation of the occupied territory.\n\nAnnouncing the measures, which involve extending Israeli control in areas that are currently under Palestinian administration, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Israel Katz, made clear they were aimed at strengthening Israeli settlements in the West Bank and pre-empting the emergence of an independent sovereign Palestine.\n\nThe measures, passed by the Israeli security cabinet, also make it easier to find out who owns land in the West Bank and for non-Arabs to buy property in the territory. It was not initially clear when the new rules would come into effect but they require no further approval.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz said in a joint statement with the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.\n\nThe EU called the measures \u201canother step in the wrong direction\u201d and said sanctions were \u201cstill on the table\u201d, including the possible suspension of some parts of the EU-Israel trade agreement.\n\nA joint statement by a group of Arab and Islamic states, which will be central to Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of implementing a peace plan in Gaza, said they \u201ccondemned in the strongest terms the illegal Israeli decisions and measures aimed at imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty\u201d.\n\nThe signatories \u2013 including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkey \u2013 said the new measures would \u201cinflame violence, deepen the conflict and endanger regional stability and security\u201d.\n\nThe UK said it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the Israeli measures. \u201cAny unilateral attempt to alter the geographic or demographic makeup of Palestine is wholly unacceptable and would be inconsistent with international law,\u201d a UK statement said. \u201cWe call on Israel to reverse these decisions immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government, which is hosting a visit by the Israeli president Isaac Herzog, also joined the global condemnation. \u201cAustralia objects to the Israel security cabinet\u2019s decision to expand Israel\u2019s control over the West Bank. This decision will undermine stability and security,\u201d the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement. \u201cThe Australian government has been clear that settlements are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. Altering the demographic composition of Palestine is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cA two-state solution remains the only viable path to long-term peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u201d\n\nThe outrage at the Israeli measures came on the eve of a planned White House meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump on Wednesday. The administration made no formal comment, but a White House official issued a statement to reporters indicating its opposition.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has clearly stated that he does not support Israel annexing the West Bank,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration\u2019s goal to achieve peace in the region.\u201d\n\nThe new measures are wide ranging and aimed directly at authority and control of territory in the West Bank. They repeal a law dating back to the era of Jordanian rule before 1967, which banned the sale of land to non-Arabs.\n\nThey also transfer authority over building licences in Hebron from the Palestinian-run municipality to the Israeli civil administration, the army\u2019s occupation authority in the territory. The transfer could violate a 1997 Hebron protocol, which divided the city into two sectors.\n\nThe Jewish settlement around Rachel\u2019s Tomb in Bethlehem is also transferred from Palestinian governance to direct Israeli control.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority\u2019s control over its designated parts of the West Bank has been severely weakened over past decades by lack of money, aggressive Israeli obstruction and settlement-building, as well as its own corruption. It issued a statement in its capital in Ramallah warning that the new Israeli measures were aimed at \u201cdeepening attempts to annex the occupied West Bank\u201d."

    "content": "Tehran has told the US not to allow Israel to destroy the chance of reaching an agreement over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme amid speculation that Benjamin Netanyahu intends to use a hastily arranged White House meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday to divert negotiations.\n\nIran\u2019s intervention came as the Israeli prime minister flew to Washington to plead with Trump not to negotiate a deal with Tehran if it excludes limiting the country\u2019s ballistic missile programme, dropping its support for proxy forces in the region and curtailing human rights abuses at home.\n\nNetanyahu is deeply concerned that Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are prepared to strike a deal confined to limiting the scope of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, which in Israel\u2019s view would do nothing to rein in the long-term threat Tehran poses to the region.\n\nView image in fullscreen Iran\u2019s security chief, Ali Larijani, said Washington \u2018must remain vigilant regarding Israel\u2019s destructive role\u2019. Photograph: Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said he would \u201cpresent to the president our approach around our principles on the negotiations\u201d. He is expected to provide Trump with fresh intelligence about Iran\u2019s military capabilities, including new long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nNetanyahu faces a delicate task in setting out his stall because he risks being seen as challenging two of Trump\u2019s most respected aides by mapping out a set of demands that could force the US into prolonged conflict with Iran.\n\nHe also risks angering Trump by opening up divisions in the Republican party, especially if he reminds the US president that he made repeated unfulfilled promises to come to the help of Iranian protesters.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s turbulent relationship with Trump was already entering another rough patch as he continues to stall on his Gaza peace plan by barring a Palestinian technocratic body from entering the strip, and seeking in effect to annex the West Bank.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Netanyahu. Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA\n\nIn a sign that he knows he is treading on thin ice, Netanyahu agreed to take the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, with him. Before heading to Washington, Huckabee said there was \u201can extraordinary alignment between US and Israel on Iran\u201d, and that as far as he knew the two sides shared the same red lines.\n\nIran expressed its anger at Israel\u2019s intervention. Ali Larijani, the the head of the Supreme National Security Council, the body overseeing Tehran\u2019s negotiating strategy, said: \u201cThe Americans should think wisely and not allow him, with his posturing, to create the impression before his flight that he is going to the United States to set the framework of nuclear negotiations. They must remain vigilant regarding Israel\u2019s destructive role.\u201d\n\nLarijani met the mediators between Washington and Tehran in Muscat to discuss the agenda for further talks.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, said in his weekly press briefing: \u201cOur negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s alarm about a potential deal that undercuts its ambitions for regime change in Tehran has grown ever since the US agreed to reopen indirect talks with Iran, which started in Oman on Friday.\n\nThe Iranian government also still faces political challenges at home, with more reformist groups and academics issuing statements protesting against the suppression of dissent and, in particular, the arrest of leaders of the Reformist Front.\n\nThe front issued a further statement expressing its shock, and warning that the regime\u2019s exclusionary approach and baseless accusations would worsen the political deadlock and \u201cstrengthen the violent and war-mongering factions supporting Israel\u201d. It called on Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to intervene urgently to secure the release of its leadership.\n\nEven if the planned second round of talks are confined to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, as Tehran wants, there is no guarantee of success because it insists on maintaining its right to enrich uranium as fuel for nuclear power plants, something the US permitted under the 2015 deal but Trump has appeared to rule out.\n\nTrump has sent the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships to the region, which are capable of hitting a huge range of Iranian military and economic sties. The US has also buttressed the air defences of US bases across the region.\n\nThe head of Iran\u2019s atomic energy authority has said Tehran may be prepared to dilute its stock of highly enriched uranium to 60% purity, a limited concession given the 2015 deal limited it to enriching to 3.75% purity."

    "content": "Tarique Rahman, who after 17 years in exile is the main contender to be the next prime minister of Bangladesh, has pledged to end entrenched corruption and put the country on a \u201cnew path\u201d as voting began in the first free and fair elections in almost two decades.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian before polls opened on Thursday morning, Rahman promised a new era of clean politics, including a \u201ctop down, no tolerance\u201d approach to graft, if his Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) was brought to power.\n\nAccording to polls, the BNP are likely to win a sizeable majority over their rival, the Islamist party Jamaat e-Islami, returning the party to power after 20 years.\n\nSoftly spoken and understated, 60-year-old Rahman acknowledged the elections were taking place at a pivotal but \u201cchallenging\u201d moment for Bangladesh, which has long ranked among the world\u2019s most corrupt countries and where democracy has faced a sustained attack for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe saw in the last regime that corruption was encouraged,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cOur economy was left destroyed. It will take time, but if we establish real accountability in every part of the government and send a message down the chain, that will eventually control corruption.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen BNP supporters cheer Tarique Rahman at a rally in Pallabi, on 8 February. Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters\n\nThe elections are the first since the fall of autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the summer of 2024. The student-led uprising that toppled Hasina after 15 years in power left an estimated 1,400 people dead according to the UN, after it was met with a ruthless and violent crackdown by the state.\n\nLast year, the former prime minister \u2013 now exiled in India \u2013 was found guilty of crimes against humanity committed during the final days of her rule and sentenced to death.\n\nFor the past three elections, Hasina and her Awami League party have been accused of rigging the results and ruthlessly crushing and jailing opponents, including thousands of BNP activists and leaders.\n\nSince August 2024, Bangladesh has been led by an interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, tasked with restoring democracy and readying the country for free and fair polls. However, the country has remained in turmoil, amid a decline in law and order and frustrations over economic stagnation.\n\nAnalysts emphasised that a fair and violence-free election would be a vital step forward for the country. There are 127 million registered voters and in a bid to keep security tight, more than 900,000 police, army and security personnel have been deployed on polling day.\n\n\u201cThis is the first credible election the country\u2019s held in 17 years so it\u2019s incredibly significant,\u201d said Thomas Kean, Crisis Group\u2019s senior consultant on Bangladesh. \u201cPeople are eager to have the chance to vote after so long.\u201d\n\nIn Dhaka, young voters spoke of their thrill at experiencing democracy first hand. \u201cI am excited, this is the first time I am freely taking part in an election,\u201d said Yasmin Sorupa, 30, who said she intended to vote BNP. \u201cIn the past, I could never cast my vote because when I went to the polling station, somebody had already cast it.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen BNP supporters walk in support of Tarique Rahman during a campaign rally. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRahman returned to Bangladesh to fight the elections on Christmas day, ending more than 17 years spent as a political fugitive. He took over leadership of the BNP from his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, a giant of Bangladeshi politics and longtime political nemesis of Hasina. She died just five days after Rahman\u2019s return home in December.\n\n\u201cPhysically, I may have been out of the country but for all those years I was always connected to my people in Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as the opportunity came to serve my people, I came back.\u201d\n\nRahman\u2019s time in self-imposed exile in London, living in the suburb of Kingston with his wife and daughter, is said by associates to have mellowed him. His experiences of day-to-day British life also left an imprint, from his push for more tolerance in Bangladeshi politics to his determination to introduce weekly rubbish bin collections in the country.\n\nMany in Bangladesh say they cannot forget the corruption that flourished during the last BNP regime between 2001 and 2006, under his mother. Rahman did not dispute that \u201cmistakes\u201d had been made by his party in the past. \u201cI will not deny that. If we do, it will not help anything,\u201d he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Border Guard Bangladesh personnel stand guard next to a bullet proof bus of BNP chair and election candidate Tarique Rahman, who features alongside his late parents, Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThough Rahman did not serve an official role in the previous regime, he was seen as having undue influence and in a leaked 2008 diplomatic cable was described as \u201ca symbol of kleptocratic government\u201d.\n\nHe was jailed in 2007 as part of an anti-corruption drive by a military-backed caretaker government on charges he denies. In 2008, he was released to seek medical treatment in London, after being so badly tortured in jail that he was taken to the plane in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring Hasina\u2019s subsequent 15-year rule, he was convicted of a slew of terror and corruption charges, which he alleges were politically motivated to keep him out of Bangladesh. In 2024, after Hasina\u2019s fall, the courts overturned his convictions, finally freeing him to return home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more than 18 years and they\u2019ve failed to prove anything,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s good enough, long enough to prove that I did nothing wrong?\u201d\n\nYet not all in Bangladesh have cheered Rahman\u2019s return. Both his parents were Bangladeshi prime ministers and to many, he is just the next generation of dynastic politicians, continuing the grip that two families have had over Bangladesh since independence in 1971 and which many had hoped the July uprising would bring to an end.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman, centre, and other leaders during the last day of an election rally. Photograph: Anupam Nath/AP\n\nEven if the BNP win a sizeable majority in the election, analysts emphasised that the resurgence of the Islamist Jamaat e-Islami party and their Islamist alliance \u2013 parties that were banned under Hasina \u2013 could present major challenges for the BNP and Bangladesh\u2019s secularism in the future.\n\nJamaat e-Islami, alongside allies that follow even more hardline Islamist politics, all believe in the introduction of sharia law and are likely to gain the largest vote share in their history and form a formidable opposition.\n\nJamaat e-Islami\u2019s leader has already been accused of regressive policies and controversial views on women\u2019s rights in the home and workplace. Human rights groups have also raised an alarm over a recent surge in moral policing of women, with incidents such as girls being prevented from playing football and enforcement of modest dress and headscarves.\n\nRahman acknowledged there were \u201csome extremist people who are trying to do these things\u201d but he said it didn\u2019t have \u201cany relation with Islam or religion\u201d. Instead, he attributed it to the \u201cabsence of democracy \u2026 People were not allowed to express themselves for so long, it has built up frustration and in some cases, extremism\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tarique Rahman waves from a vehicle after he arrives back in Dhaka from London, in December 2025. Photograph: Fatima Tuj Johora/Reuters\n\nHe insisted the rise of radical Islamist politics was not a threat to the plurality of Bangladesh. \u201cIf we are able to practise democracy, if we can create jobs for young people and the opportunity to have a decent life, I believe people will come away from this kind of thought.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest geopolitical challenges facing the new government of Bangladesh will be rebuilding relations with its neighbour India. Under Hasina, India was Bangladesh\u2019s closest ally but ties severely frayed after her government fell and have become outwardly hostile in recent months.\n\nRahman acknowledged that there were \u201cissues\u201d with India and he would only want \u201ca relationship of mutual respect, mutual understanding\u201d.\n\nQuestioned on whether India and Bangladesh could rebuild a friendship while Delhi continued to give a safe haven to Hasina and hundreds of her party members, Rahman was cagey. \u201cThat depends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be on them too.\u201d"

    "content": "As the clock hit midnight, the women held their flame torches aloft and marched into the Dhaka night. \u201cThe people have given their blood, now we want equality,\u201d they shouted above the roar of the traffic.\n\nFor many in Bangladesh, the past few weeks have been a cause for jubilation. The first free and fair elections in 17 years have been promised for Thursday, after the toppling of the regime of Sheikh Hasina in a bloody student-led uprising in August 2024 in which more than 1,000 people died.\n\nOpposition figures long persecuted and jailed are now running as candidates, freely holding rallies for the first time in years. The former prime minister is languishing in exile in India and facing a death sentence for crimes against humanity in Bangladesh, and her Awami League party is banned from contesting the election.\n\nWomen marched in Dhaka at midnight\n\nYet for swathes of women in the country, including those who were at the forefront of the revolution, the hope of the election has become tinged with disappointment and fear, amid a resurgence of regressive Islamist politics that it is feared will impinge upon women\u2019s rights and a dearth of female candidates in the running.\n\n\u201cThis was meant to be an election representing change and reform. Instead, we are seeing women being systematically erased and their rights threatened,\u201d said Sabiha Sharmin, 25, as she took part in the midnight march. \u201cWe worry this election will throw the country back 100 years.\u201d\n\nAmong the most oppressed political movements of the Hasina era, when elections were rigged and opponents persecuted, was Jamaat e-Islami, an Islamist party that believes in bringing sharia law to Bangladesh. It was banned and its leaders jailed, disappeared or sentenced to death.\n\nSince Hasina\u2019s fall, Jamaat e-Islami has mobilised with unprecedented gusto, positioning itself as a rival to the veteran Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) that was previously expected to make a clean sweep of the elections.\n\nLimited polling still suggests BNP will win the election but it appears as if Jamaat e-Islami will earn a historic share of the vote and be a significant force after the election. \u201cWhether it\u2019s as a sizeable opposition or a government in power, the future of Bangladesh\u2019s politics looks like a heavily Islamist party will be at its centre,\u201d said Thomas Kean, Crisis Group\u2019s senior consultant on Bangladesh.\n\nView image in fullscreen People board an overcrowded train in Dhaka to travel home to vote in the national election. Photograph: Fatima Tuj Johora/Reuters\n\nCritics say the resurgence of conservative Islamist politics has already begun to seep into society. In rural areas, girls were prevented from playing football by religious leaders who termed it indecent, and women have reported mounting harassment if they do not cover their hair or dress modestly.\n\nWhile Jamaat e-Islami has put forward a manifesto focusing on reform, women\u2019s safety from harassment and clean politics, the party is not running a single female candidate. Rhetoric from the party\u2019s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, has had a chilling effect.\n\nIn an incendiary interview with Al Jazeera, he said a woman could never lead the party as it was un-Islamic. A post on Rahman\u2019s X account then compared women\u2019s work to prostitution, before it went viral and was deleted with claims he had been hacked. Comments he made last year also resurfaced, denying the existence of marital rape and describing rape as \u201cimmoral women and men coming together outside marriage\u201d.\n\nLast year, the alliance of Islamist parties forced the government to reject proposals of a women\u2019s commission on equality. \u201cEqual rights would push women into competition with men in a way that disadvantages them,\u201d said Mamnunul Haque, secretary general of the hardline Islamist party Khelafat Majlish, speaking at the time.\n\n\u201cThese are the kinds of views and policies you hear in Iran and Afghanistan,\u201d said Zayba Tahzeeb, 21, a physics student who attended the Dhaka midnight march. \u201cWomen\u2019s sovereignty, our freedoms, our independence: all are at stake in this election.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Taslima Akhter (fourth from right) of the Ganosamhati Andolon party at a campaign rally in Dhaka. Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmong the policies proposed by the party is reducing women\u2019s working hours from eight hours to five, with the government subsidising the lost income, so women can spend more time at home. Women make up 44% of the country\u2019s workforce, according to the International Labour Organization, the highest proportion in south Asia, and paid work is a right fiercely guarded by women across economic strata.\n\nThe sense of frustration grew after the National Citizen party (NCP), which was formed by the student leaders who toppled Hasina and positioned itself as the party of progress, announced in December it would join the Jamaat e-Islami alliance in the election. The party that had forged itself as a political alternative with women at the forefront is now fielding just two female candidates.\n\nTajnuva Jabeen, a doctor and founder member of NCP, was one of a wave of women who left after the Jamaat e-Islami alliance was announced \u2013 a decision made without consultation by a few select men at the top of the party.\n\n\u201cIt was such a clear betrayal,\u201d Jabeen said. \u201cThis was a historic opportunity to create a third political force, to represent the change that so many people died for in the July uprising. Instead, they failed the people and silenced the women who led this movement. I\u2019m sorry to say, this election will not represent the spirit of the revolution.\u201d\n\nShe emphasised the failures towards women in this election were not Jamaat e-Islami and NCP\u2019s alone \u2013 less than 5% of the BNP\u2019s candidates are women.\n\nBangladesh, which is 91% Muslim, has had a chequered history with secularism since its independence from Pakistan in 1971. Religion-based politics were outlawed on the country\u2019s formation but dominant during military rule after 1975, before secularism was restored to the constitution in 2011.\n\nAnalysts emphasise that many now supporting Jamaat e-Islami are simply disenchanted with the political old guard. Since 1971, the country has swung between two parties, Awami League and the BNP, both of which have been accused of indulging in dynastic politics and rampant corruption.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jamaat-e-Islami\u2019s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, centre, and colleagues at an election rally in Dhaka. Photograph: Anupam Nath/AP\n\nJamaat e-Islami appears particularly popular among young, first-time voters, who make up 42% of the electorate and are hungry for change. The authoritarian nature of Hasina\u2019s regime somewhat discredited secularism and made voters more open to Islamist politics this time around, say analysts.\n\nOne of the fresh faces of Jamaat e-Islami is Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem Arman, a barrister up for election in Dhaka. The son of an executed Jamaat e-Islami leader, he was abducted under the Hasina regime and spent eight years imprisoned and tortured in one of her notorious underground facilities. He emerged from his cell the day after Hasina was toppled, initially believing he was being dragged out to finally be executed.\n\n\u201cIt was systematic torture for eight years, worse than death,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cIt felt like I was buried alive. But God gave me a second life. I am here to represent all those who were taken to the dark cells and never came out.\u201d\n\nPushing a message of reform and anti-corruption, he insisted the fears of women towards his party were unfounded and part of a political smear campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to urban elites, their talking points are whether women can be in the top position of the government, whether women can wear whatever they want,\u201d Arman said. \u201cThese are \u2013 I\u2019m sorry to use the word \u2013 feminist demands. The ground level is very different. The primary requirement of the women on the ground, the working class, is safety and that\u2019s our prime concern.\n\n\u201cMaybe in the near future you will see women running on our ticket too,\u201d he added.\n\nFemale supporters of Jamaat e-Islami take part in a march in Dhaka\n\nIn an attempt to demonstrate the party\u2019s commitment to women, thousands of female Jamaat e-Islami supporters took to the streets of Arman\u2019s constituency in Dhaka to deny that the party would restrict their freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe policies they are proposing will improve women\u2019s lives and their safety,\u201d said Sirajim Munira, 27. \u201cI think it will be good for the country to bring in Islamic law because it will make us honest and corruption-free.\u201d\n\nAinum Nahar, 58, said Jamaat\u2019s grassroots were driven by women. \u201cJamaat empowers us,\u201d she said. Yet she agreed that women should never head the party. \u201cAs an Islamic party, it is prohibited for women to be leaders,\u201d Nahar said. \u201cBut we will stand behind, to inspire them, to encourage them and to move the country forward.\u201d"

    "content": "A return to the traditional lentil and rice dishes that have nourished generations of Nepalis could save them from a diabetes epidemic prompted by the influx of western junk foods, doctors have said.\n\nIn a country where one in five of those over 40 has type 2 diabetes, the foods enjoyed by their grandparents have showed remarkable results in reversing the condition.\n\nDiabetes medication is largely unaffordable in Nepal, and type 2 diabetes often sets off a cascade of complications which can include kidney disease, limb loss and blindness. Uncontrolled, it will eventually lead to premature death.\n\n\u201cFor many families, diabetes is not just a medical condition, but a long-term social and economic burden,\u201d said Dr Ashish Tamang, a resident doctor based in Kathmandu.\n\nA pilot study in the Nepalese capital involving 70 hospital patients with long-established diabetes helped 43% into remission by putting them on a calorie-controlled traditional diet. An ongoing trial involving 120 people in villages and communities on the outskirts of cities has shown similar promise.\n\n\u201cIt is very early days but around half are free from diabetes at four months, with an average weight loss of only 4-5kg,\u201d said Prof Mike Lean, a diabetes and human nutrition expert from the University of Glasgow.\n\nThe approach is being rolled out more widely, as part of a four-year study led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Dhulikhel hospital, Nepal. They hope to show the diet can also prevent people at high risk of type 2 diabetes from developing the condition.\n\nType 2 diabetes is characterised by high blood sugar levels, caused by the body not making enough of the hormone insulin, or the insulin it makes not working properly. It is often triggered by excess weight.\n\nLean was part of a UK team who showed in 2017 that putting patients on weight loss diets of soups and shakes could reverse their diabetes. The programme is now part of standard NHS diabetes care.\n\nAfter the results were published, he was approached by doctors working in Nepal to see whether a similar approach could work in the south Asian country. It could, he believes, be even more effective there than it is in the UK.\n\nPeople from Asian backgrounds, are genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes. This means \u201cthey only have to put on a smaller amount of weight before they start getting diabetes\u201d, Lean said. But it also means that they \u201cdon\u2019t have to lose a lot to get rid of it\u201d.\n\nWhile UK patients might need to lose between 10 and 15kg to reverse their diabetes, \u201cin Nepal it\u2019s around half that,\u201d Lean said. \u201cIt makes the task a fair bit easier.\u201d\n\nThe team therefore set out to develop a plan that used cheap, local ingredients.\n\nParticipants were asked to follow a weight loss plan of 850 calories a day for eight weeks \u2013 typically a breakfast of yoghurt and fruit, and main meals of lentils and rice, known as dal bhat. They then switched to a higher-calorie version of the same diet to maintain their lower weight.\n\nDuring screening camps, people found to have diabetes, or to be at high risk of it were given a cup, measuring glass and weighing equipment along with a diet plan to ensure they were sticking to specific portion sizes. They were also invited to attend regular support group sessions.\n\nThe idea was to deliver an intervention in communities, without the need for doctors or hospitals, with the help of the female volunteers who make up the backbone of the country\u2019s health system.\n\nTrial design documents describe the plan as one that \u201cstresses a disciplined (traditional) eating pattern, avoiding snacking and high-fat/sugar processed western-type foods\u201d.\n\nA 2025 study found 87% of packaged foods sold in Kathmandu shops exceeded World Health Organization recommended thresholds for contents such as sugar, fat and salt.\n\nLean said the approach was \u201cnot rocket science\u201d. But it was \u201cway more effective than any drug or medicine, and traditional medicines that don\u2019t do anything\u201d.\n\nHe also encouraged participants to turn back to brown rice rather than double-milled white rice, which has fewer nutrients \u2013 including lower levels of Vitamin B1, which plays a role in how the body deals with carbohydrates.\n\nThe expanded study originally won UK government funding but fell victim to cuts. The Howard Foundation has stepped in with \u00a31.78m to allow it to continue. The project will also create educational materials on the drivers of diabetes.\n\nLean puts the blame for soaring type 2 diabetes rates in Nepal squarely on the importation of western junk foods. He has spoken to Nepalis who \u201cremember the first bicycle arriving in their village\u201d. That bicycle was carrying sweets and soft drinks, he says. And as transport connections improved, junk food started arriving by motorcycle and then by car and van \u201cand now the stuff is everywhere\u201d.\n\nLower activity levels, where advances in technology make work less physically intense, are also a driver of rising rates, the study team said.\n\nAt conferences, Lean says he has been approached by officials from neighbouring countries also struggling with rising diabetes rates. \u201cThey all said: \u2018if this works in Nepal, it will work for us.\u2019\u201d"

It can be fatal in up to 75% of cases, but it does not spread easily between people.\n\nCountries including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan implemented temperature screenings at airports after India said cases of the virus had been found in West Bengal.\n\nThe WHO said the risk of international disease spread was considered low and that it did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions based on current information.\n\nIn 2025, four laboratory-confirmed fatal cases were reported in Bangladesh.\n\nThere are currently no licensed medicines or vaccines specific for the infection."

    "content": "An explosion has ripped through a Shia mosque on the outskirts of Pakistan\u2019s capital during Friday prayers, killing 31 people and injuring at least 169 others, according to officials. Police said they were investigating whether the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.\n\nThere were fears the death toll from the blast at the Khadija al-Kubra mosque in Islamabad could rise as some of the injured were reported to be in a critical condition. Television footage and social media images showed police and residents transporting the injured to nearby hospitals.\n\nRescuers and the injured described a harrowing and chaotic scene, with bodies lying on the carpeted floor of the mosque.\n\nHussain Shah said he was praying in the mosque\u2019s courtyard when a sudden, loud explosion occurred. \u201cI immediately thought that some big attack has happened,\u201d he told Associated Press.\n\nWhen he entered the mosque, many of the injured were screaming and crying out for help. Shah said he counted about 30 bodies inside, while the number of injured appeared to be significantly higher.\n\nAnother person in a clip shared on social media said there were at least two attackers and that they had fired at people before detonating bombs. \u201cPeople were lying in the pool of blood. I saw people\u2019s heads and limbs separated from their bodies.\u201d\n\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on its Telegram channel. It has been blamed for previous attacks on Shia worshippers, who are a minority in the country. Militants often target security forces and civilians across Pakistan.\n\nThough attacks are not so frequent in Islamabad, there has been a surge in militant violence in Pakistan in recent months, blamed largely on Baloch separatist groups and the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is separate from, but allied with, Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban.\n\nPakistan\u2019s president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, condemned the attack in separate statements and extended condolences to the families of those killed. They instructed that all possible medical assistance be provided for the injured.\n\n\u201cTargeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,\u201d Zardari said. \u201cThe nation stands with the affected families in this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSharif said he had ordered a full investigation. \u201cThose who are responsible must be identified and punished,\u201d he said.\n\nPakistan\u2019s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, also condemned the attack, and asked authorities to ensure the best medical care was provided.\n\nFriday\u2019s attack occurred while Uzbekistan\u2019s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is on an official two-day visit, was attending an event in Islamabad with Sharif. The event was several miles from the mosque.\n\nA top Shia leader, Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri, expressed deep sorrow over the attack.\n\n\u201cSuch a terrorist act in the federal capital is not only a serious failure in protecting human lives but also raises significant questions about the performance of the authorities and law enforcement agencies,\u201d he said. He asked for people to donate blood as the hospitals in Islamabad were in urgent need of supplies.\n\nPakistan\u2019s mainstream media faced a backlash after they initially failed to report the attack.\n\nNadir Gurmani, a journalist with Dawn TV, wrote on X: \u201cThose who don\u2019t understand why people are losing trust in traditional media should just look at the media\u2019s role in today\u2019s coverage of suicide blast in Islamabad. News was circulating on social media, but TV channels did not carry even a single ticker.\u201d\n\nOne of the deadliest attacks in Islamabad took place in 2008, when a suicide bombing targeted the Marriott hotel, killing 63 people and injuring more than 250. In November last year, a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Islamabad, killing 12 people.\n\nThe latest attack comes nearly a week after the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army carried out attacks in the south-western Balochistan province, killing about 50 people. Security forces killed more than 200 \u201cterrorists\u201d in response, according to the military."

What disgusting and racist comments. No wonder Reform leader Nigel Farage has backed him.\n\nI have and I know that they are sickened by his views and demand his apology.\n\nI challenge Jim Ratcliffe to join me on Stockport Road, meet the hard-working business people, struggling residents, and look them in the eye and listen to them.\n\nAnd the Green party issued this statement from its byelection candidate in Gorton and Denton, Hannah Spencer .\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the Greens have joined those strongly criticising Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s claim that the UK is being \u201ccolonised\u201d by migrants.\n\nIn light of the crisis we face as a country, Antonia is exactly the leadership the civil service need to embrace systemic reform to rewire the state, take on vested interest and deliver for the British people.\n\nAntonia is a disrupter. She isn\u2019t settled with the status quo. She is one of the few senior officials that has always fought against the computer says no culture embedded in the British state\n\nThis is a desperate attempt from a senior male official whose time has passed but spent their career getting Britain into the mess it finds itself in today. A computer says no culture, that cannot challenge the status quo.\n\nSteven Swinford from the Times says McDonald\u2019s comments have provoked a furious backlash from people within government. He has posted this comment from a government source .\n\nSir Simon McDonald , the former permanent secretary of the Foreign Office, has urged No 10 to do \u201cmore due diligence\u201d as it prepares to replace the cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald, with Antonia Romeo, the frontrunner for the role. Rowena Mason has the story.\n\nThe UK economy expanded by only 0.1% in the final three months of last year, according to official data, as falling business investment and weak consumer spending led to little momentum going into 2026. Tom Knowles has the story.\n\nAnyone who watches football knows the beautiful game is a shining example multiculturalism; people from across the world playing in harmony. In light of this, Radcliffe\u2019s crass and insensitive comments just underline how out of touch and offensive he truly is. His reign at Man Utd has been marked by mass dismissals of loyal staff and chaos on the pitch. Frankly, his right to comment on UK affairs should have ended the moment he sloped off to Monaco to avoid paying his taxes.\n\nThe GMB union has alos criticised Jim Ratcliffe over his comments about immigration. The union represents workers employed by Ineos, the chemicals company set up and run by Ratcliffe. Andy Prendergast, the GMB\u2019s national secretary, said:\n\nHe also suggested that Ratcliffe has been \u201csiphoning wealth\u201d out of Manchester United , while offering \u201clittle contribution\u201d to the city.\n\nCalling for curbs on levels of immigration is one thing; portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force is quite another.\n\nThese comments go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood: a place where people of all races, faiths and none have pulled together over centuries to build our city and our institutions, including Manchester United FC.\n\nAndy Burnham , the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has joined those criticising Jim Ratcliffe over his claim that the UK is being \u201ccolonised\u201d by immigrants.\n\n2h ago 08.49 GMT Minister escalates row with \u2018hypocritical\u2019 Ratcliffe over claim UK colonised by immigrants\n\nGood morning. As Joe Coughlan and Rob Davies report, last night Downing Street said that the Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe should apologise for his comments that the UK is being \u201ccolonised\u201d by immigrants.\n\nAlthough Ratcliffe\u2019s claim that the UK population had increased by 12m over the past five years was shockingly and absurdly inaccurate, it was still moderately surprising that Downing Street criticised Ratcliffe so quickly and so explicitly. In the past, when public figures have made anti-immigration comments, the default government response has often been to say that they have a point and that these concerns are understandable. It is to soon to know whether the Ratcliffe rebuttal is evidence of a new approach, but Morgan McSweeney, who was the PM\u2019s chief of staff until Sunday, was one of the figures in Downing Street most nervous about being seen as pro-immigration, and there is speculation that, with him out of the building, Starmer might be bolder about articulating his progressive instincts.\n\nWhat No 10 says it important because, when the PM speaks out, ministers feel confident piling in behind. Jake Richards, the justice minister, has picked up the message. He has been doing a broadcast round this morning and he sounds like he feels licensed to escalate the attack on Ratcliffe. He told Times Radio:\n\n[Ratcliffe] he certainly doesn\u2019t have to apologise for having an opinion. But personally, and I think, the prime minister thinks, that that language is offensive to so many people. It is completely absurd to think that our country is being \u2018colonised\u2019, which implies some kind of invasion or taken over. That\u2019s not right at all.\n\nRichards also suggested Ratcliffe was a hypocrite.\n\nLet\u2019s just be very clear that Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s comments yesterday both were offensive in terms of the language used, he got his facts wrong, and there\u2019s also something that I find quite offensive, that this man who moved to Monaco to save \u00a34bn in tax is now lecturing us about immigration. There\u2019s something that I find slightly hypocritical about that.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Richards letting rip like this if McSweeney were still in charge in Downing Street.\n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n\n9.30am: NHS England publishes its monthly performance figures.\n\nMorning: Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is due to speak to the media on a visit to a training centre in the south of England.\n\nMorning: Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is visiting a Manchester hospital.\n\n11am: Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, speaks at a night-time economy conference in Liverpool. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region respectively, are also speaking.\n\nMorning: David Lammy, the deputy PM and justice secretary, is visiting a youth offending service in south London.\n\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n\nNoon: John Swinney, Scotland\u2019s first minister, takes questions from MSPs.\n\n1.30pm: The Manchester Evening News is hosting a Gorton and Denton byelection debate.\n\nAnd the government is publishing its representation of the people bill, which will lower the voting age to 16.\n\nIf you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (between 10am and 3pm), or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.\n\nIf you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social.

    "content": "Schroders has agreed a \u00a39.9bn takeover by a US investor, ending two centuries of family ownership of the historic British asset management group.\n\nChicago-based Nuveen will buy the City firm, it said on Thursday, in a deal that will create one of the world\u2019s biggest fund managers, controlling about $2.5tn (\u00a31.8tn) of assets.\n\nThe takeover ends two centuries of independence for the group, which will keep London as its largest office with about 3,100 workers and retain its Schroders branding.\n\nFounded in 1804 by the Hamburg financier Johann Schr\u00f6der, the company started life as a merchant bank in London. It listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1959 and sold off its investment banking arm in 2000 to focus on asset management.\n\nThe Anglo-German banking dynasty, now headed by the heiress Leonie Schroder, is estimated to have a net worth of \u00a33.93bn, according to the Sunday Times rich list. She owns a 485-hectare (1,200-acre) Hampshire estate, Hurstbourne Park.\n\nHowever, the investment company has been looking to cut costs in recent years after a plunge in its share price, prompting interest from potential buyers. Last year, Schroders announced a \u00a3150m cost-cutting drive in an effort to boost performance, after coming under pressure from US rivals such as BlackRock and Vanguard that have started offering cheaper investment products.\n\nAs recently as last July, Richard Oldfield, its chief executive, denied speculation that the billionaire Schroder family would be willing to sell the company in which they still had a 44% stake. The takeover values the family\u2019s stake at \u00a34.4bn.\n\nOldfield has done away with several parts of the business since taking the helm in November 2024, including cutting a joint-venture with Lloyds Banking Group offering mass-market financial advice, as well as pulling out of operations in Brazil and Indonesia.\n\n\u201cIn a competitive landscape where scale can help deliver benefits, in Nuveen we see a partner that shares our values, respects the culture we have built and will create exciting opportunities for our clients and people,\u201d Oldfield said.\n\nThe transaction would \u201csignificantly accelerate our growth plans to create a leading public-to-private platform with enhanced geographic reach\u201d, he added.\n\nThe deal amounts to 612p a share, more than a one-third premium on Schroder\u2019s closing price on Wednesday. That includes 590p in cash plus a 22p dividend.\n\nSchroders shares soared 30% to 592p on Thursday. The deal, which will need approval from shareholders, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026."

    "content": "Rachel Reeves has suggested 2026 is the year Labour can start to deliver on its economic promises; but 0.1% GDP growth in the final quarter of last year is hardly the springboard she was hoping for.\n\nIn the supportive message on X she sent on Monday as Keir Starmer\u2019s future appeared under threat, the chancellor claimed \u201cthe conditions for the economy to grow are there\u201d.\n\nBut the latest data, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggests that despite six interest rate cuts from the Bank of England since mid-2024, consumers and businesses are not yet taking the hint.\n\nOutput from the key services sector was flat over the final quarter of the year, the ONS said, with construction \u2013 crucial to Labour\u2019s ambitious housebuilding targets \u2013 declining by 2.1%.\n\nOver the year as a whole, GDP expanded by 1.3%. That was a modest improvement on the 1.1% recorded in 2024 \u2013 while GDP per head, the measure that matters more for living standards \u2013 was up 1%, after flatlining in the previous year.\n\nThat was certainly not a performance in line with Labour\u2019s pre-election promise to secure \u201cthe highest sustained growth in the G7\u201d.\n\nAs the ONS points out, Canada, under its prime minister, Mark Carney, had faster growth of 1.6% in 2025, and while fourth quarter data for the US has not yet been published, it is clear that it is likely to have outpaced the UK.\n\nThe Treasury would highlight external factors, including the instability created by Donald Trump\u2019s on-off tariff policies, which caused chaos in financial markets and forced US-facing businesses to rethink supply chains.\n\nBut economists also point to the imposition of Reeves\u2019s \u00a325bn employer national insurance rise last April, and the chaotic run-up to her second tax-raising budget in late November.\n\nHowever, there are some reasons to be more optimistic for 2026. Policymakers at the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting meeting last week pointed the way to a seventh interest rate cut, perhaps as soon as next month, despite leaving rates unchanged at 3.75%.\n\nThat was largely because, alongside post-dated tax rises, Reeves\u2019s budget included a slate of price-cutting measures, including a reduction in energy bills, which will help inflation to move back down to target.\n\nThe Treasury will be hoping that another rate cut, alongside its anti-inflation measures, will cheer up wary consumers and reassure businesses. Forward-looking surveys have pointed to an upturn of late, though there is continued anxiety about job cuts.\n\nReeves will have been encouraged by news that business investment, which Labour sees as crucial to improving the UK\u2019s flailing productivity, was up 3.5% in 2025 (though it fell in the fourth quarter).\n\nAnd she intends to make next month\u2019s spring forecast from the Office of Budget Responsibility as much of a non-event as possible, avoiding the turmoil that surrounded last year\u2019s botched statement, when she made welfare cuts that then had to be reversed.\n\nEconomists now expect growth to pick up in the coming months \u2013 unless Reeves\u2019s colleagues choose this moment for a potentially destabilising tilt at Starmer. As Thomas Pugh, of consultancy RSM, put it, \u201cthe biggest risk now is a protracted and noisy leadership contest that could reopen Pandora\u2019s box of tax increases and inject a renewed bout of uncertainty\u201d."

His offensive remarks are wrong and play into the hands of those who want to divide our country.\u201d\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, was blunt in his condemnation of the comments. \u201cI call bullshit,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201c\u2018Immigrants\u2019 who pay their taxes in this country. Unlike Jim Ratcliffe. Who\u2019s the real patriot?\u201d\n\nAndy Prendergast, the GMB\u2019s national secretary, said Ratcliffe\u2019s tenure at Manchester United had brought \u201cmass dismissals of loyal staff and chaos on the pitch\u201d.\n\n\u201cRadcliffe\u2019s crass and insensitive comments just underline how out of touch and offensive he truly is,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, his right to comment on UK affairs should have ended the moment he sloped off to Monaco to avoid paying his taxes.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Britain\u2019s seventh-richest man, who moved to tax-free Monaco in 2020, took aim at immigrants and people receiving state support and cited statistics that were two decades out of date to suggest the UK had been \u201ccolonised\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford \u2026 you can\u2019t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it\u2019s 70 million. That\u2019s 12 million people.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe\u2019s claim is incorrect, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS estimated that the population of the UK was 67 million in 2020 and was last anywhere close to 58 million in 2000.\n\nOn Thursday, ministers echoed the prime minister\u2019s condemnation of the comments, accusing Ratcliffe of hypocrisy.

That\u2019s not right at all,\u201d he said.\n\nRatcliffe also faced condemnation from Manchester United fans, who said the club co-owner was \u201ca total embarrassment\u201d and \u201cout of touch\u201d. In a statement, the supporters\u2019 group the 1958 criticised Ratcliffe\u2019s intervention and his decision to comment \u201con the issues of our country while living in Monaco to avoid paying tax\u201d.\n\nRatcliffe bought a minority share in United in 2023 and has been labelled an \u201cincompetent clown\u201d by fans over his handling of football operations.\n\nFans, who protested against Ratcliffe and the club\u2019s co-owners the Glazers before United\u2019s recent home game against Fulham, said Ratcliffe had priced out loyal fans and imposed \u201cdraconian measures\u201d on season ticket holders, and was forcing an unwanted new stadium on them.\n\nThe Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club (MUMSC) said Ratcliffe had used \u201clanguage frequently used in far-right narratives\u201d.\n\nA statement said: \u201cManchester United is a global club built on diversity \u2013 on players, staff and supporters from every background, faith and ethnicity. The strength of our club, and of our country, lies in that diversity.\n\n\u201cWe stand with all communities who reject racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and hatred in all its forms, and we call for leadership that unites rather than divides.\u201d\n\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trust said: \u201cComments from the club\u2019s senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder.\u201d\n\nThe anti-racism football campaign group Kick It Out called Ratcliffe\u2019s comments \u201cdisgraceful and deeply divisive\u201d. In a statement, the organisation said: \u201cIn addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it\u2019s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fanbase and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.\n\n\u201cThis type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.\u201d"

Share\n\n7h ago 02.56 GMT Trump wins another award no one knew existed, this time as the 'undisputed champion' of claiming that coal is not destroying the planet At a White House event to promote coal on Wednesday, Donald Trump was presented with yet another award that was apparently invented just for him, when he received a trophy for being the \u201cundisputed champion of beautiful, clean coal\u201d from an industry executive. View image in fullscreen Donald Trump was presented with the \u201cUndisputed Champion of Beautiful Clean Coal\u201d trophy by Jim Grech, the chief executive of Peabody Energy, at the White House on Wednesday. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images There is, of course, no such thing as clean coal, but Trump has devoted himself to rebranding the climate destroying fossil fuel as not just clean but beautiful as well \u2013 in the way that an Oval Office dripping in gold fittings is beautiful. As our colleague Dharna Noor reported earlier, the coal industry poured $3.5 million into efforts to elect Trump in 2024. Reports show the president\u2019s efforts to keep aging coal plants open could push up already-soaring energy bills nationwide. Trump grinned as he accepted the trophy and then sat down to sign an executive order directing the Pentagon to give preference to coal in long-term energy contracts. Trump stated affection for the coal industry goes back to his first campaign in 2016, when he was presented with a miner\u2019s helmet by the West Virginia Coal Association, an industry group that endorsed him, and briefly put it on to mime digging with a shovel. After removing the helmet at that 2016 rally, Trump then launched into an extended riff on how it might have impacted his hair, and bemoaned the fact that he could no longer use aerosol hairspray over what he considered to be phony climate concerns. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not allowed to use hairspray anymore because if affects the ozone. You know that, right?\u201d Trump said to laughter at the time. \u201cI said, \u2018You mean to tell me\u2019 \u2014 \u2019cause you know hairspray\u2019s not like it used to be, it used to be real good,\u201d he added, to more laughs. \u201cGive me a mirror. But no, in the old days, you put the hairspray on, it was good. Today, you put the hairspray on, it\u2019s good for 12 minutes, right?\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 so if I take hairspray and if I spray it in my apartment, which is all sealed, you\u2019re telling me that affects the ozone layer?\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d I say, no way, folks. No way!\u201d \u201cNo way!\u201d he added to cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s like a lot of the rules and regulations you people have in the mines, right? It\u2019s the same kind of stuff.\u201d Share Updated at 03.19 GMT\n\n8h ago 02.34 GMT Bondi came to Congress armed with 'search history' of which Epstein documents one Democrat viewed A document held by the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, during her combative appearance before the House judiciary committee on Wednesday suggests the justice department is keeping a record of what lawmakers look at when they view unredacted copies of documents in the files from the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late child sex offender. Throughout the hearing, Bondi launched into a series of prepared attacks on lawmakers whenever she was asked about her department\u2019s failure to keep the names of Epstein\u2019s victims confidential, as required by law, while protecting the privacy of powerful men accused of abusing them. Among the more heated exchanges was Bondi\u2019s questioning by Pramila Jayapal, a progressive Democratic congresswoman from Washington. Photographs of Bondi show she held a piece of paper labelled \u201cJayapal Pramila Search History\u201d during questioning, which listed eight documents from the files, one of which, about a \u201ctorture video\u201d apparently sent to Epstein by Dubai\u2019s powerful Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem Jayapal discussed.

Photograph: Kent Nishimura/Reuters After Jayapal urged Bondi to turn around and apologize to victims of Epstein who were in the room behind her, the attorney general refused to do so, and instead tried to turn the discussion to her predecessor, Merrick Garland. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she ask Merrick Garland this?\u201d Bondi asked, repeating a Republican talking point that Democrats were unconcerned with Epstein\u2019s crimes until Donald Trump, who socialized with Epstein for nearly two decades, was back in office. (In fact, Epstein\u2019s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was prosecuted by the justice department while Garland was in office, and many of the files were, at that time, still part of an ongoing prosecution.) When Jayapal pressed her further to turn to the victims and apologize, Bondi told the Republican chairman, Jim Jordan, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get in the gutter with this woman, she\u2019s doing theatrics.\u201d (Jordan has faced persistent allegations that, when he was a wrestling coach at Ohio State University he ignored the sexual abuse of student wrestlers by a team doctor.) Share Updated at 03.25 GMT\n\n9h ago 01.24 GMT Pentagon let Customs and Border Protection fire anti-drone laser near El Paso this week \u2013 reports The Pentagon allowed US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to use an anti-drone laser earlier this week, leading the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to suddenly close the airspace over El Paso, Texas, two people familiar with the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday. As Trump administration officials appeared to pass the buck for the use of the laser, one US official told a Fox News producer at the Pentagon that the directed energy weapon was in CBP\u2019s control when a balloon was mistaken for a drone and shot down near El Paso. In January, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, agreed to loan the directed energy counter drone platform to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Fox reported. The Washington Post military affair correspondent Dan Lamothe also reports: \u201cAirspace was closed by the FAA near El Paso late Tuesday after CBP personnel launched a counter-drone laser weapon without full inter-agency integration, officials say. That weapon had recently been transferred temporarily by the Pentagon to DHS.\u201d Another national security journalist, Michael Weiss, reports that a source in the military confirmed to him the laser was fired by DHS, angering senior officers at US Northern Command. \u201cEvery Gen and Adm at NORTHCOM is pissed that DHS did an operation and told no one because homeland defense is what NORTHCOM does,\u201d the source told Weiss. \u201cEven the base commander at Ft Bliss called the Pentagon and NORTHCOM furious.\u201d Share Updated at 01.35 GMT\n\n9h ago 00.47 GMT House Democrat investigates Trump's sudden reversal on US-Canada bridge after reported lobbying by Republican donor Robert Garcia, the senior Democrat on the House oversight committee, wrote to Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, on Wednesday to demand information about his reported role in turning Donald Trump against a new, publicly owned bridge connecting the US and Canada after he met a billionaire Republican donor who owns a rival bridge. In his letter, Garcia cited reporting from the New York Times that Trump\u2019s sudden threat on Monday to block the opening of the new bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan, came after a call from Lutnick, who had just met with Matthew Moroun, the owner of the private Ambassador Bridge between the two cities, who has donated more than $600,000 to Trump and the Republican party.

As such, I request information regarding any communications and undue influence the Moroun family may have had with the Trump administration.\u201d Garcia asked Lutnick to turn over documents including all communications related to his meeting with Moroun on Monday and his discussions with Trump or anyone else in the White House related to the new bridge and the old bridge. \u201cThe Gordie Howe international bridge, which President Trump once touted as a \u2018vital economic link between our two countries,\u2019 has been under construction for years,\u201d Garcia noted. \u201cThe Moroun family\u2019s latest attempt to delay or block the opening of the bridge by directly appealing to you and to the Trump Administration appears to have proven successful.\u201d Share Updated at 01.42 GMT\n\n10h ago 00.02 GMT US House passes bill to require voter ID and limit vote by mail The narrowly divided US House passed the Republican-sponsored Save America Act on Wednesday, which would required proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID at the polls, imposing a barrier to voting that, research shows, more than 9% of US citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, do not have readily available. All but one of the Republicans in Congress voted for the measure, and all but one of the Democrats voted against it. The legislation is not guaranteed to pass the Senate. Henry Cuellar, a conservative Texas congressman who was recently given clemency by Donald Trump, was the only Democrat to vote for the bill. Share Updated at 00.29 GMT\n\n10h ago 23.47 GMT Majority in US House votes to end Trump's tariffs on Canada The US House just passed a joint resolution terminating the national emergency declared by Donald Trump to impose tariffs on imports from Canada. Six Republicans joined almost all Democrats to pass the measure by a vote of 219-211 in the narrowly divided House. The rebuke is likely symbolic, since it would take a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate to override a presidential veto, and Trump left no doubt about his unwavering support for tariffs in a blistering social media post as the votes were cast. \u201cAny Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\u201d Trump warned just two minutes before enough Republicans voted for the resolution to form a majority. Polling shows that the tariffs are unpopular with a majority of Americans, including business owners who traditionally support Republicans. The supreme court is expected to rule soon on the Trump administration\u2019s effort to get lower court rulings, which found that the president does not have the power to impose tariffs, overturned. Share Updated at 23.56 GMT\n\n12h ago 22.32 GMT Dharna Noor Climate leaders gathered outside the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters on Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration\u2019s plans to repeal the legal finding underpinning all federal climate regulations. \u201cThis is corruption, plain and simple. Old fashioned, dirty political corruption,\u201d said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse at the rally. \u201cThis is an agency that has been so infiltrated by the corrupt fossil fuel industry that it has turned an agency of government into the weapon of the fossil fuel polluters.\u201d The rollback of the 2009 endangerment finding will be finalized by Donald Trump and EPA administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters yesterday. The seminal ruling established a legal basis to regulate planet-warming pollution under the Clean Air Act. The move comes a year and a half after Trump on the campaign trail directly requested $1bn from oil bosses, promising he would scrap environmental rules if elected. \u201c[Zeldin] is saying to the fossil fuel industry, you now are gonna get what you paid for,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey at the gathering. \u201cThis is cash and carry: You give us the cash, and then we carry away all of the environmental protections.\u201d At the event, environmental non-profits including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice and the Sierra Club pledged to file litigation over the forthcoming rollback. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be taking this fight to the courts, and we are going to win,\u201d said Manish Bapna, president of the national environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council. The plan to kill the endangerment finding is \u201cterrifying\u201d, said Talia Brandt, a 10-year old Maryland resident and member of environmental health organization Moms Clean Air Force, who appeared at the rally with her mother, Liz. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to be here fighting for our future,\u201d she said. Share Updated at 22.45 GMT\n\n12h ago 21.49 GMT Border chief Greg Bovino emailed agent who shot Chicago woman five times to praise him Evidence made public on Wednesday showed that Gregory Bovino, a border patrol chief who was the face of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts until last month, praised a federal agent who shot a Chicago woman during an immigration crackdown last year.\n\n\n\nMarimar Martinez, a US citizen, was shot five times by a border patrol agent in October while in her vehicle. She was charged with felony assault after homeland security officials accused her of trying to ram agents with her vehicle. But the case was abruptly dismissed after video evidence showed that the agent who shot her had first steered his vehicle into Martinez\u2019s car. The new evidence \u2013 which includes emails, text messages and videos \u2013 was released this week after a US district judge, Georgia Alexakis, lifted a protective order. Federal prosecutors had argued the documents could \u201cfurther sully\u201d Exum\u2019s reputation. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the United States government has expressed zero concern for the sullying of Ms Martinez\u2019s reputation,\u201d Alexakis countered. The border patrol agent who shot Martinez, Charles Exum, was not wearing his body camera during the incident, according to Martinez\u2019s lawyer, but body camera video recorded by another agent and released on Tuesday showed the moments that led up to the shooting from inside Exum\u2019s vehicle. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get aggressive and get the [expletive] out,\u201d one agent could be heard saying. After Exum gets out of the car, the sound of five shots being fired can be heard on the video.

Photograph: United States Attorney\u2019s Office/Reuters Emails and text messages to Exum included one message from Bovino sending encouragement to Exum after the shooting. \u201cIn light of your excellent service in Chicago, you have much yet left to do!!\u201d Bovino wrote to Exum on 4 October, hours after Martinez was shot, in an email urging him to put off his retirement. Another text exchange highlighted by lawyers for Martinez showed that when a fellow agent asked Exum if his superiors were being \u201csupportive\u201d after the shooting, Exum replied: \u201cBig time. Everyone has been including Chief Bovino, Chief Banks, Sec Noem and El Jefe himself \u2026 according to Bovino.\u201d On the day Martinez was shot, she had followed a border patrol vehicle and honked her horn to warn others of the presence of immigration agents. Body camera footage showed agents with weapons drawn and rushing out of the vehicle.\n\n\n\nLawyers for Martinez pushed to make evidence in the dismissed criminal case public, saying they were especially motivated to do so after a federal agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis under similar circumstances.\n\n\n\nIn one group text, other agents congratulated Exum as Bovino had, calling him a \u201clegend\u201d and offering to buy him beers. In another text exchange, first made public when Martinez testified in Congress last week, another agent sent Exum a Guardian report on the shooting in which her lawyer said she had \u201cseven holes in her body from five shots\u201d. \u201cRead it,\u201d Exum replied. \u201c5 shots, 7 holes\u201d. Exum then appeared to brag to colleagues about his shooting skills. \u201cI fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,\u201d he wrote. View image in fullscreen Images of text messages from the phone of Charles Exum, the border patrol officer who shot Marimar Martinez last year, were displayed at a news conference on Wednesday, Photograph: Erin Hooley/AP Bovino\u2019s belligerent persona, in frequent Fox News appearances, on social media and while leading operations in front of cameras deployed to produce propaganda for the Trump administration, had earned him a starring role in the made-for-TV crackdown until last month, when he was caught lying about Alex Pretti, the VA nurse who was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis despite posing no threat. The shooting of Martinez came during the height of the Chicago-area crackdown last year, during which a federal judge concluded that Bovino had lied to her about having been struck by a rock during a confrontation with protesters in the city.\n\n\n\nThe government unsuccessfully fought the release of the documents on the shooting, including an email from Bovino, who led enforcement operations nationwide until video evidence showed that he had lied when he said Pretti \u201capproached law enforcement with a weapon\u201d, \u201cviolently resisted\u201d and wanted to \u201cmassacre law enforcement\u201d. Martinez\u2019s lawyer are pursuing a complaint under a law that permits individuals to sue federal agencies. They outlined instances of DHS lying about Martinez after the shooting, including labeling her a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d and accusing her of having a history of \u201cdoxxing federal agents\u201d. The Montessori school assistant has no criminal record and prosecutors haven\u2019t brought evidence in either claim.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a time where we just cannot trust the words of our federal officials,\u201d attorney Christopher Parente said at a news conference where his office released evidence.\n\n\n\nThat included an agent\u2019s hand-drawn diagram of the scene to allege how Martinez \u201cboxed in\u201d federal agents. It included three vehicles Parente said \u201cdon\u2019t exist\u201d.\n\n\n\nMany of the emails, text messages and videos were released on Tuesday night by the US attorney\u2019s office. View image in fullscreen Marimar Martinez after a press conference on Wednesday, where her lawyers displayed evidence gathered from the federal agents who shot her in Chicago last year. Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Reuters Last week, Martinez offered emotional testimony about her ordeal to Democrats in Congress in which she described her shock at being described as terrorist based on the false account of the incident offered by federal agents. Martinez recalled: The news in the jail that evening had my story and I was being called a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019! They said I \u2018rammed\u2019 federal agents. I was in shock. If they only knew I was just months away from paying off my car and I would never intentionally damage my vehicle much less be crazy enough to hit a law enforcement vehicle. On Friday I was teaching the young children at the Montessori school and we were singing and dancing and getting ready for spooky season preparing fall activities to do the following week and on Saturday my own government was calling me a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 and I was in a federal detention center with bullet holes all over my body.

    "content": "Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO and co-founder, is facing growing criticism over a joke he made about US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) monitoring international employees during an event for the company.\n\nEmployees publicly expressed outrage about Benioff\u2019s comments in his keynote address at an internal conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, and leaders at Slack, which Salesforce owns, have said he should apologize.\n\nBenioff reportedly asked international employees to stand, before joking that ICE agents were present and monitoring them, drawing boos from the crowd, several employees told media outlets including Wired and 404Media. A recording of his speech published on an internal Salesforce site was edited to cut his remarks about ICE, Business Insider reported.\n\nThe incident comes as hundreds of Salesforce workers reportedly plan to urge Benioff to denounce ICE and cancel future business with the agency, Wired and CNBC reported.\n\nMuch like other billionaires, Benioff\u2019s politics appear to have taken a marked turn in Trump\u2019s second term. He for years was closely aligned with some liberal causes, including a 2018 measure in San Francisco to tax large corporations in the city to fund homeless services, and in an interview with the Guardian criticized billionaires for \u201choarding\u201d their wealth.\n\nLast fall Benioff told the New York Times he \u201cfully supported\u201d the president, and said Trump should send national guard troops to San Francisco, before apologizing and walking those comments back. His company, which has long had contracts with ICE, has sought to increase its business with the agency.\n\nNow he faces outrage within his company and others with ties to Salesforce over his recent jokes about international employees, ICE and a remark about not understanding Bad Bunny\u2019s recent Super Bowl performance. Employees have condemned his comments on Slack and LinkedIn.\n\nFarone Rasheed, a Salesforce employee, wrote on the networking site: \u201cI am fearful for my friends and co-workers on my team who are here on international visas \u2026 I am shocked, angered, sad and frustrated by the views espoused by the leadership at Salesforce this week. I\u2019m sharing this here because, frankly, I fear retaliation for that.\u201d\n\nRob Seaman, Slack\u2019s general manager, was critical of Benioff\u2019s comments in an internal company message, according to Business Insider.\n\n\u201cI want to acknowledge the jokes that happened this morning at CKO,\u201d Seaman wrote, the outlet reported. \u201cI cannot defend or explain them. They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.\u201d\n\nSalesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

But above the monks were more enduring Washington touchstones such as the 19ft-tall seated statue of Lincoln, carved from Georgia marble, and the aspiration inscribed into the memorial to \u201cbind up the nation\u2019s wounds\u201d.\n\nThe monks had come with balm for America\u2019s current wounds and found the weather obliging as the capital emerged from a recent cold snap, though plenty of ice and snow lingered. As the monks took their places below the memorial, a song boomed from loudspeakers: \u201cSpreading peace, love and harmony all the way to Washington DC.\u201d\n\nSeveral made speeches as birds and the occasional plane flew overhead. Tencho Gyatso, a niece of the Dalai Lama, the highest spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, read a letter paying tribute to the monks: \u201cTheir commitment, including enduring physical hardship and challenging weather conditions over a journey of more than 2,000 miles, has drawn attention both within the United States and internationally,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe message of peace and mutual understanding conveyed through their conduct, marked by humility and calm presence, has resonated with many people as they encountered along the route \u2026 May their walk help sow the seeds of greater peace, understanding and compassion in the United States and beyond.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Venerable Bhikkhu Pannakara, the group\u2019s leader, speaks near the Lincoln Memorial.

We have to revise that and say all people are created people.\n\n\u201cAnd this walk has shown that no matter what race you might belong to, whatever ethnicity you might come from, whatever religious faith you might adhere to, whatever the color of your skin might be, we all celebrate peace.\u201d\n\nPeace walks are a cherished tradition in Theravada Buddhism. Some of the monks have walked barefoot or in socks during parts of the journey to feel the ground directly and help them be present in the moment.\n\nBut the effort has had its perils. In November, outside Houston, the group was walking on the side of a highway when their escort vehicle was hit by a truck. Two monks were injured; Venerable Maha Dam Phommasan had his leg amputated.\n\nPhommasan, abbot of a temple in Snellville, Georgia, rejoined the monks near Washington and addressed the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial from his wheelchair.\n\nThe peace walk garnered interest from millions of people on social media, with many sharing messages of support.\n\nView image in fullscreen Some monks have walked barefoot or in socks during parts of the journey. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA\n\nOn Wednesday, King\u2019s son, Martin Luther King III, posted on X that the walk is \u201ca powerful reminder that peace is practiced step by step. In a divided time, this is what it looks like to stand up for the best of who we are. Love demands endurance. Peace is strength.\u201d\n\nSome in the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial held roses or signs that included \u201cWarriors of peace welcome\u201d, \u201cEqual rights for all humans\u201d and \u201cEvery heart needs an Aloka\u201d. They joined in a chant of \u201cToday is going to be my peaceful day\u201d led by Bhikkhu Pannakara, spiritual leader of the Walk for Peace.\n\nJacquelyn Gray, 64, who works in construction logistics, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been following them since the day they left and I was impressed that somebody would be so committed to something. I know as well as anybody else that they aren\u2019t gonna get here and, magically, peace will cover the planet, but I admire their commitment to this cause.\u201d\n\nKatharine Naujoks, 57, a high school science teacher, said: \u201cThe world needs a bit of communalism and camaraderie and peace and goodwill. A lot of people are looking for that. I want to be a part of this positive experience.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the monks\u2019 epic walk, which will end in nearby Annapolis, Maryland on Thursday, Naujoks added: \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing, the fact that they had to come in through the coldest time in Virginia, Maryland and DC. We\u2019re not usually that cold, so it\u2019s amazing to me. It just shows that it\u2019s an important thing. It\u2019s important to them and it\u2019s important for everybody else around here.\u201d\n\nCould Washington politicians learn something from them? \u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d she said."

    "content": "The top US aviation agency has lifted a surprise 10-day closure of airspace above the US-Mexico border town of El Paso, Texas, just hours after it abruptly announced that it would close off the skies for \u201cspecial security reasons\u201d.\n\nWhile some officials claimed that Mexican cartel drones invaded US airspace, in recent days a balloon was reportedly mistaken for a drone.\n\nThe initial, vague citation of security concerns prompted still more questions as conflicting narratives surrounding this surprising closure and its abrupt reversal have since emerged.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) posted the \u201ctemporary flight restriction\u201d notice on its website late on Tuesday local time, stating that a 10-nautical-mile circle up to 18,000ft around the El Paso international airport in Texas would be off limits for all commercial, cargo and general aviation flights.\n\n\u201cNo pilots may operate an aircraft in the areas covered,\u201d the FAA said. It said the closure would remain in place until 20 February, and the notice warned that the government \u201cmay use deadly force\u201d against any pilot who did not comply with the instructions.\n\nBut by Wednesday morning, and after hours of mayhem in which both airlines, local politicians and tens of thousands of travelers were caught off-guard, the FAA wrote on X that the order had been lifted. \u201cThere is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal,\u201d it said.\n\nSince then, officials have offered a range of narratives to explain the closure.\n\nThe US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said on Twitter/X: \u201cThe FAA and DOW [\u201cdepartment of war\u201d] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.\n\n\u201cThe threat has been neutralized,\u201d Duffy also said, \u201cand there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe New York Times, citing a source familiar with this shutdown, said the airspace closure was due to testing of anti-drone technology.\n\nDonald Trump signed an executive order in June to develop anti-drone capacity, and said drug cartels were using drones to smuggle fentanyl.\n\nCBS News later added still more intriguing reporting that sources had said the closure was due to FAA and Pentagon disagreements over \u201cdrone-related tests\u201d involving a high-energy laser. The Associated Press also reported the Pentagon allowed US Customs and Border Protection to use an anti-drone laser without first consulting the FAA.\n\nCBS News reported that this technology was deployed earlier this week to shoot down what were thought to be foreign drones. But the airborne object was just a party balloon, sources told the outlet, indicating that one balloon was brought down.\n\nBut a Democratic Texas congresswoman for El Paso, Veronica Escobar, took issue with Trump officials\u2019 drone claim, saying it was \u201cnot the information that we in Congress have been told\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere was not a threat, which is why the FAA lifted this restriction so quickly,\u201d the Times quoted Escobar as saying. \u201cThe information coming from the administration does not add up.\u201d\n\nAsked about the allegations of cartel drone activity, Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said: \u201cThere is no information regarding drone use at the border. If the FAA or any other US government agency has any information, they can ask the Mexican government.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not speculate. We will get the information and maintain what we have always maintained: constant communication.\n\n\u201cMexico\u2019s airspace wasn\u2019t closed \u2013 Texas\u2019s airspace was closed,\u201d Sheinbaum added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out exactly why.\u201d\n\nEl Paso\u2019s mayor, Renard Johnson, slammed the unexpected closure.\n\n\u201cI want to be very, very clear that this should\u2019ve never happened,\u201d the Times quoted him as saying. \u201cYou cannot restrict air space over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership.\n\n\u201cThat failure to communicate is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBefore the FAA reversed its decision, Escobar had called on the agency to lift what she said was a highly consequential and unprecedented decision that \u201cresulted in significant concern within the community\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cThere was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations.\u201d\n\nA large area west of El Paso, and along the border with Mexico, was also shut down for the same period. It is not clear if that airspace will reopen.\n\nThe restrictions came so suddenly, with the FAA providing only three hours\u2019 notice, that radio communications from El Paso international airport revealed a dumbfounded pilot of a passenger plane being told that they would not be able to leave the next day.\n\nAn air traffic controller can be heard asking the arriving Southwest flight if they plan to depart again. \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go to the hotel,\u201d the pilot can be heard saying in audio captured by atc.com, a live air traffic radio company.\n\n\u201cRoger,\u201d replied the controller. \u201cJust be advised there is a [temporary flight restriction] going into effect \u2026 at 0630 for the next 10 days.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the airport is totally closed?\u201d the pilot asks with a chuckle, to which the controller responds: \u201cApparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.\u201d\n\nTemporary flight restrictions are issued for natural disasters, such as wildfires and hurricanes, as well as major sporting events and emergency or national security situations.\n\nWhile the ban was still in place overnight, the airport said on its Facebook page that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded and travelers should contact their airlines to get the most up-to-date flight status information.\n\nAn airspace closure would have had a significant impact on the city of nearly 700,000 people, which neighbors the city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico.\n\nEl Paso airport, through which nearly 3.5 million passengers transited last year, operates multiple direct flights across the US. Photos taken early on Wednesday showed the airport halls nearly deserted. Employees told local media they were unsure what prompted the halt of all flights.\n\nOscar Lopez in Mexico City contributed reporting"

    "content": "Bondi clashed with Democrat representatives Jasmine Crockett and Ted Lieu during her Epstein files hearing.\n\nOver the span of five hours on Wednesday, United States lawmakers questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi over the US Justice Department\u2019s (DOJ) handling of documents related to convicted late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBondi, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, defended the DOJ\u2019s handling of the release of the Epstein records and said there are \u201cpending investigations\u201d in the case.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Bondi\u2019s congressional hearing.\n\nWhy is Pam Bondi being questioned?\n\nBondi testified before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, in a hearing entitled \u201cOversight of the US Department of Justice\u201d, but the Epstein files quickly became a primary focus.\n\nSince the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump and his administration have consistently faced questions about the decision to withhold or redact documents related to Epstein.\n\nThat new law, called the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed into law in November with bipartisan support. It requires the Justice Department to publish all of its documents related to Epstein in an easily searchable format.\n\nThough the law allows for some limited redaction to protect the identities of victims, critics argue that scores of documents have been published with heavy redactions. Some of those blacked-out sections appear to shield the identity of powerful figures involved with Epstein.\n\nDuring her opening statement on Wednesday, Bondi, a prosecutor from Florida, defended her record of addressing sexual abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,\u201d she said.\n\nEpstein victims were present\n\nWith several victims of Epstein seated behind her in the hearing room, Bondi forcefully defended the department\u2019s handling of the files related to the well-connected financier, an issue that has dogged her tenure.\n\nDuring her opening remarks, Bondi deemed Epstein a \u201cmonster\u201d and issued an apology to the victims.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster,\u201d Bondi said.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, asked the Epstein victims to raise their hands if they had not had a chance to meet with a member of the Justice Department. All the victims raised their hands.\n\nThe victims included Danielle Bensky, who met Epstein in 2004 when she was 17 years old. She has accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her.\n\n\u201cThere was such a lack of empathy today. There was such a lack of, honestly, humanity today,\u201d Bensky told an NBC programme after the hearing.\n\nBondi clashes with Democrats\n\nCongressional Democrats accused the US attorney general on Wednesday of engaging in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of the Jeffrey Epstein files and turning the Department of Justice into an \u201cinstrument of revenge\u201d for Trump.\n\nMaryland Democrat Jamie Raskin criticised the slow release of the Epstein files and the redactions made to the documents.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been ordered by subpoena and by Congress to turn over six million documents, photographs and videos in the Epstein files, but you\u2019ve turned over only three million.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed by Representative Jayapal, Bondi refused to turn and face the Epstein victims in the audience and apologise for what Trump\u2019s Justice Department has \u201cput them through\u201d. She accused the Democrat of \u201ctheatrics\u201d.\n\nTexas Democrat Jasmine Crockett stormed out of the hearing after a spat with Bondi. \u201cThis is a big cover-up. And this administration is still engaged in it. In fact, this administration is complicit,\u201d Crockett said.\n\nDuring a heated exchange, Crockett said Bondi would be remembered as one of the worst attorneys general, prioritising loyalty to Trump over the law, before yielding the rest of her time.\n\nBondi shot back that Crockett had not even tried to question her and accused her of ignoring the fact that Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries had taken money from Epstein after his conviction, a claim Jeffries has denied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attorney general also clashed with Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California. Lieu asked whether Trump had attended a party with underage girls, a question Bondi deemed \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\nBondi insisted there was no evidence Trump had committed a crime.\n\nLieu suggested that her answer amounted to lying under oath, noting that Trump\u2019s name appears repeatedly in the Epstein files. Bondi shot back: \u201cDon\u2019t you ever accuse me of committing a crime.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s name appears multiple times in the released Epstein files, but not in connection with the sexual abuse of women. Rather, the records primarily show that he and Epstein were acquainted and had a social relationship.\n\nFor instance, Trump was listed as a passenger on Epstein\u2019s private jet at least eight times between 1993 and the mid-1990s.\n\nOn February 1, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One about his name being mentioned in the latest tranche of Epstein files: \u201cI was told by some very important people that not only does it absolve me, it\u2019s the opposite of what people were hoping, you know, the radical left.\u201d\n\nRepublicans join Democrats in questioning Bondi\n\nBondi accused Democrats of using the Epstein files to distract from Trump\u2019s successes, even though it was Republicans who initiated the furore over the records and Bondi herself fanned the flames by distributing binders to conservative influencers at the White House last year.\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to require the files\u2019 release, accused the Justice Department of a \u201cmassive failure\u201d to comply with the law as he questioned why billionaire Leslie Wexner\u2019s name was redacted in an FBI document listing potential co-conspirators in the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.\n\nBondi said Wexner\u2019s name appeared numerous times in other files the department released and that the DOJ unredacted his name on the document \u201cwithin 40 minutes\u201d of Massie spotting it.\n\n\u201cForty minutes of me catching you red-handed,\u201d Massie replied.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna revealed the names of six men, including Wexner. The other names made public are Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the head of Dubai-based logistics company DP World, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov and Nicola Caputo. Al Jazeera could not independently verify their identities or affiliations.\n\nKhanna said he was revealing the men\u2019s names after he reviewed the files with Massie.\n\n\u2018Trump orders prosecutions like pizza\u2019: Bondi came to the president\u2019s defence\n\nRaskin and other Democratic lawmakers condemned the prosecutions brought by the DOJ against Trump\u2019s political foes, such as former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve turned the people\u2019s Department of Justice into Trump\u2019s instrument of revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump orders up prosecutions like pizza and you deliver every time he tells you to.\u201d\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, is the only person behind bars in connection with Epstein. She was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking underage girls and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has not been accused of any wrongdoing regarding Epstein but he fought for months to prevent the release of the files about his one-time friend.\n\nA rebellion among Republicans eventually forced the president to sign off on the law mandating the release of all the records.\n\nThe move reflected intense political pressure to address what many Americans, including Trump\u2019s own supporters, have long suspected to be a cover-up to protect rich and powerful men in Epstein\u2019s orbit.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated denials of any knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes have come under scrutiny due to a 2019 FBI interview \u2013 contained in the Epstein files \u2013 with Palm Beach\u2019s then-police chief Michael Reiter.\n\nReiter told the FBI that Trump had called him in 2006 \u2013 when the sex charges against Epstein became public \u2013 to say: \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re stopping him, everyone has known he\u2019s been doing this.\u201d"

Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun.\n\nVan Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024, and she had no weapons registered to her, police said.\n\nThey said weapons had been seized from the suspect\u2019s home some years ago, but subsequently returned after the lawful owner petitioned to get them back, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nFamilies mourn\n\nOn social media, family members of the victims posted messages mourning their loved ones, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nOne man, Abel Mwansa, posted on Facebook that his 12-year-old son, also named \u2060Abel, had been killed, while a woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the \u2060victims.\n\nAnother woman, Cia Edmonds, wrote on the social media platform that her 12-year-old daughter Maya was fighting for her life in hospital after being wounded in the head and neck.\n\nSchool shootings rare\n\nSchool shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws, and the attack in the small community of Tumbler Ridge, population 2,700, has sent shock waves throughout the country.\n\nDarryl Krakowka, the mayor of the town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, became emotional on Wednesday as he called on the close-knit community, which he described as \u201cone big family\u201d, to come together amid the tragedy."

    "content": "New documents reveal Terje Rod-Larsen facilitated visas for Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims and was listed for a $10m payout, prompting Palestinians to question whether the peace process was engineered by blackmailed diplomats.\n\nThe Norwegian diplomat who was a key architect of the 1993 Oslo Accords is facing a storm of corruption and blackmail allegations after new documents revealed he was deeply embedded in the inner circle of late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTerje Rod-Larsen, a central figure in the Middle East \u201cpeace process\u201d in the 1990s, is implicated in newly released United States Justice Department files and Norwegian media investigations that expose a relationship involving illicit loans, visa fraud for sex-trafficked women, and a beneficiary clause in Epstein\u2019s will worth millions of dollars.\n\nThe revelations have sent shockwaves through the diplomatic community and led to the resignation of Rod-Larsen\u2019s wife, Mona Juul \u2013 herself a pivotal figure in the Oslo negotiations \u2013 from her post as Norway\u2019s ambassador to Jordan and Iraq this month. Her security clearance was also revoked.\n\nPalestinian leaders are now questioning whether Oslo\u2019s foundational agreements of the two-state solution were brokered by a mediator vulnerable to elite blackmail and foreign intelligence pressure.\n\nThe plan was heralded in the Western world at the time, and in the 30 years since, has been trampled on by successive Israeli governments, with the far-right leadership now openly pushing for annexation of the occupied West Bank.\n\n\u2018Extraordinary abilities\u2019\n\nInvestigations by the Norwegian broadcaster NRK and newspaper Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv (DN) detail how Rod-Larsen used his position as president of the International Peace Institute (IPI) think tank in New York to launder the reputation of Epstein\u2019s associates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the files, Rod-Larsen wrote official letters of recommendation to US authorities to secure visas for young Russian women in Epstein\u2019s orbit, claiming they possessed \u201cextraordinary abilities\u201d suitable for research roles.\n\nIn reality, these women were often models with no academic background who were allegedly trafficked and abused by the financier. One victim told NRK she believed Epstein sent her to Rod-Larsen\u2019s institute \u201cto manipulate\u201d her, while another described how the diplomat facilitated her visa after a direct request from Epstein\u2019s assistant.\n\nThe transactional nature of the relationship was explicit. Documents show Epstein loaned Rod-Larsen $130,000 in 2013. More damningly, reports indicate that Epstein\u2019s last will and testament included a clause bequeathing $5m each to Rod-Larsen\u2019s two children \u2013 a total of $10m.\n\n\u2018Oslo was a trap\u2019\n\nFor Palestinians living under the reality of the failed agreements Rod-Larsen forged, the scandal offers a disturbing explanation for a \u201cpeace process\u201d that many believe was rigged.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, told Al Jazeera he was \u201cnot surprised at all\u201d by the corruption allegations.\n\n\u201cWe never felt comfortable with this person from the very first moment,\u201d Barghouti said. \u201cOslo was a trap \u2026 and I have no doubt that Terje Rod-Larsen was being effectively influenced by the Israeli side all along.\u201d\n\nBarghouti argued that the revelation of millions of dollars potentially flowing from a Mossad-linked figure like Epstein to the Rod-Larsen family suggests the corruption was \u201cdirected to serve Israel\u2019s interests against the interests of the Palestinian people\u201d.\n\nThe ties between the disgraced Epstein and Israel have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.\n\nThe documents have revealed more details of Epstein\u2019s interactions with members of the global elite, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the IDF (Israeli army), and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel\u2019s overseas intelligence services, the Mossad.\n\nThe missing archive\n\nThe scandal has reignited calls in Norway to open the \u201cprivate archive\u201d Rod-Larsen kept regarding the 1993 secret negotiations.\n\nMedia investigations have revealed that documents from the critical period between January and September 1993 are missing from the official Foreign Ministry archive. Critics argue these missing files could obscure the extent to which personal leverage or blackmail played a role in the concessions extracted from the Palestinian leadership during the secret talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoverning by blackmail\n\nAnalysts argue the Rod-Larsen case is symptomatic of a wider system of global governance driven by systematic blackmail and intelligence operations.\n\nWissam Afifa, a political analyst based in Gaza, drew a parallel between the exploitation of minors on Epstein\u2019s island and the geopolitical treatment of Palestinians.\n\n\u201cWe, as Palestinians, were treated as minors \u2026 considered as having no right to demand our rights,\u201d Afifa said. \u201cToday we discover that a large part of the international system is essentially \u2018Epstein Island\u2019\u201d.\n\nAfifa suggested that the \u201csilence\u201d of the international community regarding the current genocidal war on Gaza could be linked to similar networks of influence and extortion.\n\n\u201cThe world was managed from Epstein\u2019s island \u2026 in dark rooms,\u201d Afifa added. \u201cWe are victims of the influence network that Epstein managed with politicians, leaders and states\u201d.\n\nAs Norwegian authorities, including the economic crime unit Okokrim, open investigations into the scandal, the legacy of the diplomat who once shook hands on the White House lawn lies in tatters, casting a long shadow over the history of deeply flawed Middle East peacemaking."

    "content": "US Democrats seek to scrap statute of limitations for sex abuse crimes in bill named after Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n\nDemocrats in the United States Congress have proposed a new law which would fully scrap the statute of limitations for federal civil sex abuse cases.\n\nThe proposed legislation has been named Virginia\u2019s Law after Virginia Giuffre, who accused the late, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associates of sexually abusing and trafficking her in the 1990s when she was a teenager.\n\nGiuffre died by suicide in April last year after reaching a settlement in her sex-abuse case against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom and a friend of Epstein\u2019s.\n\nWhat is Virginia\u2019s Law?\n\nThe proposal for the new law has been introduced to the US Congress by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez, alongside Giuffre\u2019s family.\n\nIt is a federal bill which would remove the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits regarding sexual abuse and trafficking.\n\nCivil cases are private disputes between individuals and organisations, while criminal cases involve the government prosecuting individuals for breaking laws.\n\nUnder federal criminal law, most offences must be prosecuted within five years, but there is no time limit at all for many trafficking and child sexual abuse crimes, which can be charged decades after the fact.\n\nAccording to US federal anti\u2011trafficking law, a victim of federal trafficking\u2011related offences has 10 years to lodge a civil suit after a crime took place. If the crime took place when the victim was a minor, then they have 10 years to sue from when they turn 18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2022, Congress passed a law removing the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse, but that change did not apply to any crimes committed before that date.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Law calls for the 10-year statute of limitations for all federal civil cases relating to sexual abuse and trafficking \u2013 regardless of when abuses were committed \u2013 to be scrapped.\n\nIntroducing the law on Tuesday, Schumer told Congress: \u201cWhen the truth of Jeffrey Epstein finally started to come out, when the world finally started to listen to their stories, oftentimes the laws in the books said, \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s too late. The deadline to bring your case has passed.\n\nHe said Virginia\u2019s Law \u201cwill change that, because justice for victims of abuse should not have an expiration date\u201d.\n\nThe bill will ultimately mean that many of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims will now be able to lodge civil claims against Epstein\u2019s estate.\n\n\u201cVirginia\u2019s dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light,\u201d Giuffre\u2019s brother, Sky Roberts, said during a news conference in the US Capitol.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Law also expands victims\u2019 legal options in other respects, such as by covering relevant sex crimes committed outside the US where a US court has jurisdiction \u2013 for example, in cases where the abuser or victim is American or where there has been sex trafficking to or from the US.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Law would apply to federal cases only and will not change state statutes of limitations.\n\n\u201cThe bill applies only to federal sex abuse crimes involving the mails or interstate commerce as stipulated in 18 USC 2421 et seq,\u201d constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.\n\nThis means the bill would cover federal sex\u2011abuse and trafficking crimes, which fall under the 1910 federal law, the Mann Act \u2013 cases in which the abuse involved crossing state lines or using the mails, the internet or other channels of interstate commerce.\n\n\u201cThe federal bill would not supersede state laws that commonly create civil causes of action for sexual abuse, including assault. The state laws would complement the federal law,\u201d Fein said.\n\nHow does the bill pass into law?\n\nThe bill will have to gain the approval of enough members of the Republican-dominated Senate and the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law.\n\nThe House includes 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats empty. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independent senators who caucus with the Democratic Party. So far, there is no scheduled date for a vote on Virginia\u2019s Law in either chamber.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn both chambers, the law requires a simple majority of members present and voting, which means it needs 51 votes in the Senate and 217 votes in the House. The bill must pass both chambers before it goes to the Oval Office for the president to sign it into law.\n\nHowever, a bipartisan push succeeded last year in forcing the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files from its Epstein investigation through the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nWhat is a statute of limitations?\n\nA statute of limitations is a time limit for bringing a case. In criminal law, it sets how long prosecutors have to file charges; in civil law, it sets how long a victim has to sue their abuser.\n\nIf this time limit elapses, a defendant cannot be prosecuted or sued, even if there is strong evidence that they committed a crime.\n\nStatutes of limitations exist to limit the deterioration of evidence, promote swift enforcement of the law and provide greater legal certainty, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cMemories fade, witnesses die, and documents are commonly lost over time,\u201d lawyer Fein said.\n\nCrimes besides sexual abuse also have statutes of limitations.\n\nIn the US, statutes of limitations for nonfederal civil and criminal cases vary by state. In criminal cases, they can also vary depending on whether the sexual abuse was a \u201cfelony\u201d or \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d, and whether the victim was a minor or an adult.\n\nFelonies are serious crimes punishable by a year or more in a state or federal prison, while misdemeanours are \u201cless serious\u201d crimes that are punishable by fines, probation, or less than one year in a local jail.\n\nFor example, in Alabama, there is no statute of limitations for criminal cases of rape, sexual abuse involving violence or threats of violence, or sexual offences against a victim below the age of 16.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arkansas, the criminal statute of limitations is six years for rape and three years for certain sexual assault offences.\n\nStates usually have separate statutes of limitations for civil cases, and they can be very different from the criminal ones.\n\nMany states are moving to increase or scrap statutes of limitations for sexual abuse cases. Iowa, Vermont, California, Texas and others have eliminated or greatly extended criminal statutes of limitations for many sex crimes for both criminal and civil cases.\n\nOther states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida and Alabama, have expanded civil filing windows, often allowing victims to sue decades after the abuse or after it is discovered. Several have also lengthened or lifted criminal statutes of limitations for certain sex crimes, particularly where there is strong evidence, such as DNA.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Law will not supersede any state laws, as it will relate to federal cases only.\n\nWhat can we expect if Virginia\u2019s Law passes?\n\nThe bill would scrap civil time limits so that many survivors whose cases are currently time\u2011barred would now be able to sue. Some lawyers expect a flurry of lawsuits, particularly from Epstein victims, if this happens.\n\nIn May 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law the New York State Adult Survivors Act (ASA), allowing adult survivors of sexual assault to file civil lawsuits, regardless of when the abuse occurred. In 2019, New York had opened a similar window for people abused as children under its Child Victims Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ASA expired in late November 2023. While the Act was active, more than 3,000 civil suits were filed under it, including writer E Jean Carroll\u2019s successful sexual abuse and defamation case against President Donald Trump.\n\nIn June 2019, Carroll published an excerpt of her book in a New York Magazine article alleging that Trump had raped her in 1996. Trump denied these allegations. In November 2019, Carroll sued Trump for defamation. After the ASA took effect in 2022, she filed her lawsuit against Trump for defamation as well as sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cIf the law passes, an indeterminate number of women may bring civil actions against men identified in the Epstein files, [for example] Prince Andrew, seeking damages,\u201d Fein said.\n\n\u201cThe number is unknown because victims commonly are reluctant to sue because of [the] social stigma attached to women perceived to be promiscuous.\u201d\n\nHave some victims been barred from suing in other ways?\n\nThe Epstein Victims\u2019 Compensation Program was a fund set up in June 2020 by Epstein\u2019s estate, with court approval in the US Virgin Islands, to provide compensation to many women who say they were abused. However, they were required to waive their right to sue Epstein or his estate in exchange for the compensation.\n\nSome 225 claims were submitted under this fund before it shut down in August 2021 at the end of its remit. It is unclear whether women who received payouts from the Epstein Victims\u2019 Compensation Program would be able to benefit from Virginia\u2019s Law."

His barber shop was also demolished later that day.\n\nAgando is one of the thousands of Makoko residents forcibly evicted from their homes by the Lagos State government, in a demolition operation that began in late December and only ended when the Lagos State House of Assembly ordered it be halted earlier this month.\n\nThe government said the demolitions were being carried out due to the community\u2019s proximity to an electric power line, and that people needed to move back by 100 metres (109 yards). But authorities have gone beyond the 100-metre mark. Nonprofit organisations (NGOs) working with the community say the demolitions took place between 250 and 500 metres (about 270 and 550 yards) inside the settlement, destroying people\u2019s homes, rendering thousands homeless and causing the death of more than 12 people, including two infants, in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the weeks of demolitions, the surrounding water was dotted with canoes carrying beds, bowls and other household appliances, as anxious community members removed their valuables in case operations reached them. At the same time, there have been no plans to resettle or compensate victims.\n\n\u201cThey did not stop where they said they would; they just kept demolishing the whole place,\u201d said Innocent Ahisu, one of the community\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is where we live and get what we eat and drink. We are all sad and don\u2019t know where this will end for us.\u201d\n\n\u2018We are humans\u2019\n\nMakoko, popularly called the \u201cVenice of Africa\u201d, is a historic fishing village dating back to the 19th century, built on stilts along the coast of Lagos. It overlooks the Third Mainland Bridge, which connects the affluent Lagos Island with mainland Lagos, and its residents are predominantly fishermen who fish in the same water on which they have dwelled for decades. An economic hub, it serves markets around the city with fresh and dried seafood.\n\nAlthough it is home to about 200,000 people, the combination of poverty and lack of government development and social infrastructure has made it a slum. Yet its scenic waterways plied by canoes hawking everyday necessities and food, and its distinct culture, make it a popular destination for visitors. Much of the community sits on water, but a part is situated on land.\n\nOn an average day, the sunset\u2019s reflection on the water, coupled with rising smoke from the wooden houses and children swimming nearby, makes Makoko picturesque from a distance \u2013 its rugged imperfections that are a testament to resilience also giving it a unique beauty.\n\nBut recently, the landscape of the village has resembled the aftermath of a storm, with only the carcasses of wooden structures left in many places.\n\nAt one of Makoko\u2019s numerous processing hubs for dried fish, women working are anxious about what the demolition means for their business and economic future.\n\n\u201cWe hope they can see that we are humans and stop demolishing our homes,\u201d one of the older women who did not want to give her name said in the local dialect, Egun.\n\nThis eviction will only increase hardship for people who are already disproportionately affected by Nigeria\u2019s cost-of-living crisis, observers note.\n\n\u2018History is going to be lost\u2019\n\nPhoebe Ekpoesi, a mother of three, has been staying at a relative\u2019s house in Makoko after her home was demolished. She said everything she owns, including her business in the village, has been lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis Makoko is everything we have, my family lives here, my children go to school here, and we do not have anywhere else to go,\u201d she said with frustration.\n\nVictoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, the executive director of Spaces for Change, a Lagos-based civil society organisation advocating for urban governance, gender rights, and environmental justice, said the demolition has had a devastating effect on people like Ekpoesi.\n\n\u201cThere is disruption of their children\u2019s education, people are becoming increasingly homeless, and there is heightened vulnerability, especially among women, people with disabilities, and aged persons within the community,\u201d she said.\n\nNot only will the demolitions affect victims and community structures, but people will be deprived of communal land ownership and a sense of belonging to a place, according to Deji Akinpelu, the cofounder of Rethinking Cities, an NGO advocating against the exclusion of the urban poor.\n\n\u201cHeritage is going to be lost, history is going to be lost,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd worse still, many say, is that there has been no resettlement plan for the victims, many of whom now stay with friends and relatives, or sleep in their canoes or what is left of their structures.\n\nAlthough the state government promised on February 4 to provide money to victims, Lagos State commissioner of information, Gbenga Omotoso, told Al Jazeera that compensation will be determined only after victims have been counted and documented.\n\nAkinpelu said authorities ought to have considered compensation and resettlement before starting demolitions, not as an afterthought.\n\nAccording to advocates like Ibezim-Ohaeri, the government\u2019s failure to provide these is \u201cillegal\u201d, as they are considerations clearly stipulated by Nigeria\u2019s constitution, which forbids the government from demolishing structures without prior negotiation and prompt payment of compensation.\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has, however, defended the state\u2019s actions, saying, \u201cWhat we are doing is not demolishing the whole of Makoko. We are clearing areas to ensure they do not encroach on the Third Mainland Bridge and to keep residents away from high-tension lines.\u201d\n\nAn eviction \u2018playbook\u2019\n\nAlthough the government has cited safety as its reason for demolishing the homes, activists say there are other motives at play. Last year, local Nigerian outlets reported that the government had entered an agreement with a private contractor to develop an estate in Makoko, and promptly began sand dredging and land reclamation opposite the area.\n\n\u201cThe unofficial reason is that Makoko is sitting in a highly coveted area. Makoko sits on the waterfront overlooking the lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge. So that intersection between urban poverty and highbrow property development is one of the biggest pressures,\u201d Ibezim-Ohaeri said.\n\nForceful eviction and demolition are not new to Nigeria\u2019s economic capital. They follow a historical trend that has seen informal settlements and waterfront communities pushed out to make way for luxury estate developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1990, 300,000 people were forcefully evicted from Maroko in Lagos to make way for what has now become parts of Victoria Island and Oniru Estate, both sought-after areas for wealthy Nigerians. Otodo-Gbame faced a similar fate in 2017 when its 30,000 residents were rendered homeless, and more recently, to make way for the luxurious Periwinkle estate.\n\nAnother waterfront community, Oworonshoki, is currently being demolished, and activists say a luxurious estate might spring up in the location soon.\n\nBetween 1973 and 2024, 91 eviction operations were carried out in parts of Lagos.\n\n\u201cThere is an eviction playbook in Lagos State, and if you look at all the other evictions, it follows the same playbook,\u201d Ibezim-Ohaeri said. \u201cIt will first of all be cited that there is something wrong in that area, and at the end of the day, new highbrow developments that are far beyond the reach of the former owner will spring up in that area.\u201d\n\nIbezim-Ohaeri, who has been a counsel for Makoko since 2005, said the state has made more than 20 attempts to evict the residents of the village, but the community has resisted through court orders and pressures from civil society organisations.\n\nThe power line or the people?\n\nOther waterfront communities and informal settlements are also at risk, Ibezim-Ohaeri said, as the Lagos government recently announced its plans to reclaim more informal lands.\n\n\u201cWhat this means for Lagos is that it has continued to follow a pattern of classism right from the colonial era,\u201d said Akinpelu, who added that \u201cit is very much time for the government to start to rethink its ways because providing housing for high-income earners creates an imbalance in the city.\u201d\n\nExperts said the city should be thinking of mixed-income housing patterns that allow everyone to get shelter, and not push more people into homelessness in the city of 22 million people, where a housing crisis is brewing.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider what can give way to what. The power line or the people? The power line itself can be moved, but they found it right that the people are the ones who should move for the power line,\u201d Akinpelu said.\n\nOn January 29, Makoko community members demonstrated at the government secretariat and demanded an audience with the city\u2019s governor, but they were forcefully dispersed by the police who fired tear gas. A large banner read: \u201cA megacity cannot be built on the bones and blood of the poor.\u201d\n\nThis week, a compromise was reached by the Lagos State House of Assembly and the community that residents would not rebuild on the demolished structures, compensation would be determined by a committee, and a water-city regeneration project would be implemented in Makoko.\n\nMeanwhile, for those evicted and displaced, the future looks bleak.\n\nIn Makoko, Agando is back to sleep under the mosquito-infested shed with his pregnant wife and relatives at his pastor\u2019s house. His family is considering finding a place in Ikorodu, northeast of Lagos, as soon as they are able to get enough money.\n\n\u201cThis is what we have for now,\u201d he said."

    "content": "Bangladesh is voting in an election seen as pivotal for the nation\u2019s future as it seeks to chart a democratic course in the wake of the 2024 ouster of longtime leader Sheikh Hasina in a student-led uprising that killed hundreds.\n\nVoters headed to the polls on Thursday to cast their votes in a contest pitting the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and a Jamaat-e-Islami-led coalition that includes the National Citizens Party, formed by youth \u200cactivists instrumental in ousting Hasina. There are nearly 127 million registered voters in the South Asian country.\n\nThe two leading prime ministerial candidates are the BNP\u2019s Tarique Rahman, a political scion who has edged ahead in polls with his anticorruption campaign, and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, who is aiming to present his long-excluded Islamist party as a credible and modern force for change.\n\nPolls opened amid tight security, with hundreds of thousands of security personnel deployed on the streets, but voters cast their ballots in a mood of optimism in what is seen as the first free and fair election since 2008, when Hasina embarked on an oppressive 15-year stretch in power.\n\nJainab Lutfun Naher, a voter from the Gulshan area of Dhaka, told Al Jazeera that the experience was emotional and empowering. \u201cI want this country to prosper,\u201d she said. \u201cI want it to be democratic, where everyone has rights and freedom.\u201d\n\nAMM Nasir Uddin, the chief election commissioner, said the poll would mark a break from the \u201carranged elections\u201d of recent history. \u201cWe must forget the history of centre-grabbing and ballot box capture,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUddin noted that voter turnout had been strong, saying Bangladesh had \u201cboarded the train of democracy\u201d and would soon \u201creach its destination\u201d.\n\nIn parallel to the election, the country is also holding a referendum on constitutional reforms that the country\u2019s caretaker government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, had put together after the student-led protests.\n\nReporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera\u2019s Jonah Hull said they included \u201cinstitutional reforms, electoral, policing and constitutional reforms designed to ensure this country doesn\u2019t again slide into autocracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think this is really important as a sort of subtext to this election,\u201d he said, predicting a \u201clandslide \u2018Yes\u2019 vote\u201d. \u201cIt is, perhaps, the truest legacy of that revolution 18 months ago, in which hundreds of students gave their lives.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cbigger question\u201d, he noted, is whether the election victor actually puts the reforms into practice.\n\n\u2018Deep challenges\u2019\n\nElections were held during Hasina\u2019s tenure, but they were marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, critics have said.\n\nThe 78-year-old former leader was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India. Her Awami League party has been barred from the election.\n\nFollowing the 2024 uprising, Yunus stepped in as interim leader with a mandate to restore a credible electoral process and build consensus around reforms, acting as democratic safeguards that would balance power among different state institutions.\n\n\u201cThis election is not just another routine vote,\u201d Yunus said this week. \u201cIt will determine the future direction of the country, the character of its democracy, its durability, and the fate of the next generation\u201d.\n\nFarhana Sultana, a professor of geography at Syracuse University, told Al Jazeera that if the election succeeded in restoring public trust, it would create a foundation for the country to tackle its \u201cdeep challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cEconomic pressure, including youth unemployment and stagnating growth, is fuelling frustration among a new generation that demands real opportunity rather than symbolic change,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate, too, is an \u201congoing existential issue for Bangladesh\u201d, she said, adding that the new government would need to \u201cintegrate climate adaptation and water security into governance, economic planning and international cooperation\u201d.\n\nMore than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiyo Shangsad, or House of the Nation, with counting by hand beginning soon after polls close at 4.30pm (10:30 GMT) and results likely to be clear by Friday morning."

It is a domestic matter, basically linked to our national security. As such, it cannot be part of these negotiations.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, he said, the notion of Iran reducing its uranium enrichment to zero was \u201cnot on the table\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is impractical for a country that has already mastered this technology to reduce it to zero,\u201d he said, citing the need for enriched uranium for peaceful civilian purposes such as in cancer treatment.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we are open to verification, and anybody is welcome to come and see [our facilities] for themselves.\u201d\n\nIf the US did opt to attack Iran, as it did in a series of strikes targeting the country\u2019s nuclear facilities in June as part of a 12-day war, then Tehran would respond by attacking US military bases in the region, Larijani said.\n\nBefore leaving Doha, Larijani also met with Muhammad Darwish, the head of Hamas\u2019s Leadership Council, along with a senior delegation from the Palestinian group, to discuss the latest political developments in the region and Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, Lebanon\u2019s Al-Manar reported."

    "content": "Children in Gaza find themselves having to work to survive, sacrificing education and childhood dreams.\n\nKhan Younis, Gaza Strip \u2013 It is 5:30 in the morning. The sun hasn\u2019t fully risen, but 15-year-old Mahmoud rubs the sleep from his eyes.\n\nHe woke up this morning not in a warm bed, but on a thin mattress in a crowded tent \u2013 displaced, like hundreds of thousands of others in Gaza.\n\nAnd Mahmoud did not reach for a schoolbag to get ready for school. Instead, he picked up a rough, frayed burlap sack.\n\n\u201cThe sack is empty now, but I feel its weight even before I fill it,\u201d Mahmoud said, as he looked at his palms, calloused and scarred from carrying the sack around Khan Younis\u2019s streets, planning to begin his day. \u201cMy back hurts before I even start walking.\u201d\n\nBut Mahmoud insisted that he has to fill his sack \u2013 even if that comes at the expense of his childhood and his education.\n\nThe young Palestinian is forced by the economic situation in Gaza, brought on by Israel\u2019s genocidal war, to spend his days filling his sack with items that can be used as fuel for his family.\n\nNylon, cardboard and scraps of wood find their way into his sack.\n\n\u201cSometimes I walk for six hours just to find a few pieces of wood,\u201d Mahmoud said, describing his daily routine. \u201cThe dust from the rubble gets into my lungs. I cough all night. But I can\u2019t stop, there is no fire to bake bread.\u201d\n\nMahmoud feels a deep sense of responsibility for his family. He explained that his father was killed in an Israeli air strike early last year, one of more than 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza to be killed by Israel since the war started in October 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs his mother\u2019s eldest, and with Gaza mired in deep poverty with little help coming, Mahmoud knows that it is his job now to provide. Despite his age, he doesn\u2019t consider himself a child any more.\n\n\u201cMy mother is waiting for me to come back with something to make a fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I collect any extra, I sell it at the market to buy bread.\u201d\n\nEconomic strife\n\nMahmoud knows that life could be different. He talks about his school days with nostalgia in his voice.\n\n\u201cI used to go to school before the war, when my father was alive,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, while I am dragging the sack through the market, I see my old math teacher, and I hide behind the wall. I don\u2019t want him to see me like this \u2013 dirty, working like a donkey instead of studying. I was one of the top students.\u201d\n\nMahmoud\u2019s story is typical of Gaza\u2019s current conditions and is tied to two issues that are a direct result of Israel\u2019s genocidal war: the destruction of school buildings and the dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli attacks \u2013 including air strikes, shelling and deliberate demolitions \u2013 have left much of Gaza decimated. According to the United Nations, more than 97 percent of schools in Gaza have either been damaged or destroyed, and most of the 658,000 children of school age in the enclave have had \u201climited access\u201d to in-person learning for more than two academic years.\n\nEven now, with a shaky ceasefire in place since October, many of the schools that remain standing are used as shelters for Gaza\u2019s legion of displaced people, preventing them from being used for education.\n\nWhile there are no accurate statistics on the number of children forced to work in Gaza, Palestinians on the ground say that they have seen an increase as a result of the enclave\u2019s economic circumstances.\n\nIn November, the UN reported that Gaza\u2019s economy had \u201ccollapsed\u201d, with gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 an important economic indicator \u2013 down 83 percent compared with the pre-war period.\n\nThe weak economy, coupled with a lack of electrical power and the thousands of families whose breadwinners have been killed in the war, led to situations like Mahmoud\u2019s.\n\nChild trauma\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing in Gaza is not merely child labour,\u201d said Yaqeen Jamal, an educational psychologist who has provided psychological support to children during the war. \u201cIt is the systematic destruction of an entire generation\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese children lose their sense of security and their childhood, and they bear responsibilities that exceed their cognitive and physical capabilities,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamal said that would inevitably lead to dangers in the future. \u201cThe long-term effects will be catastrophic. We are facing a generation suffering from illiteracy and deteriorating mental health, which will create a societal gap that will be difficult to bridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebuilding schools and resuming the educational process must be the top priority, because education is the last line of defence for [these] people\u2019s identity and future,\u201d she said.\n\nReconstruction in Gaza is likely to take years, with Israel continuing to hinder the process, and uncertainty over whether Israel will attack Gaza again.\n\nThat means that children like 11-year-old Layla continue to be forced to work to help their families.\n\nHer father suffers from a physical disability that limits his mobility, leaving him unable to work. The burden has instead fallen on Layla, who goes out every day to the streets of Khan Younis to sell tea.\n\nShe walks back and forth on al-Bahr Street \u2013 the main street in Khan Younis \u2013 calling out \u201chot tea, hot tea for one shekel\u201d.\n\nLayla carried a tray containing eight cardboard cups, two-thirds full of tea, and covered each cup with aluminium foil to keep it hot.\n\nAsked about her favourite colour, she replied that it was pink, and remembered her pink room, full of her toys. Then she remembered her favourite toy, a pink doll.\n\nHer doll currently lies under the rubble of the pink room, destroyed in Israel\u2019s war.\n\n\u201cI wish that the colour pink would return to my life, that my room would return, that my family\u2019s happy life before the war would return, she said. Then she hurried away down the street, focused on selling more tea."

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration initially announced a 10-day airspace closure but removed the restriction less than eight hours later.\n\nA new United States military laser-based anti-drone system led authorities to halt air traffic in and out of El Paso, Texas, after aviation officials raised serious concerns about risks to commercial aircraft.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially announced a 10-day airspace closure on Wednesday but removed the restriction less than eight hours later, a decision reports said stemmed from miscommunication between the Pentagon and aviation regulators.\n\nOfficials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FAA acted over concerns that a military counter-drone laser system could pose risks to aircraft, according to the Reuters news agency. The FAA and the military had planned to discuss the issue at a February 20 meeting, but the army moved ahead without final FAA approval, prompting the agency to halt flights in El Paso, sources said.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nWhat happened when El Paso\u2019s airspace was shut down?\n\nOn February 10, at about 11:30pm (05:30GMT) local time, the FAA stopped all flights to and from El Paso international airport, citing \u201cspecial security reasons\u201d.\n\nThe restriction was initially expected to last for 10 days.\n\nThe order covered an area of about 16km (almost 10 miles) around El Paso, including the nearby community of Santa Teresa, and was originally set to remain in place until the night of February 20.\n\nRestrictions applied to all aircraft flying below roughly 5,500 metres (18,000 feet), while planes flying above that altitude were not expected to be affected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the airspace was closed due to the Department of Defense and the FAA dealing with an incursion by Mexican drug cartel drones, and \u201cthe threat has been neutralized\u201d.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the FAA also warned that pilots who failed to follow the order \u201cmay be intercepted, detained and interviewed by law enforcement/security personnel\u201d.\n\nThe agency added that authorities could use deadly force if it was \u201cdetermined that the aircraft poses an imminent security threat\u201d.\n\nThe airspace closure risked disrupting activity in one of the largest cities in the US, as El Paso is home to nearly 700,000 residents and is among the country\u2019s 25 most populous cities.\n\nA restriction of this scale has only been applied once before in El Paso, after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when US airspace was closed nationwide following the coordinated airliner hijackings that led to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York and damage to the Pentagon.\n\nWhy did the FAA close El Paso\u2019s airspace?\n\nThe agency initially cited \u201cspecial security reasons\u201d.\n\nTransport Secretary Duffy said that a cartel drone had breached US airspace, an explanation that was echoed by officials at the White House and the Pentagon.\n\nHowever, according to media reports, people briefed on the situation said the shutdown was linked to the Defense Department\u2019s use of new high-energy laser technology designed to counter unmanned aircraft.\n\nBloomberg News, citing a source familiar with the matter, reported that the Pentagon was also flying drones as part of the tests, with some operating outside normal flight paths.\n\nThe activity occurred in airspace near El Paso international airport, prompting FAA concerns about potential interference with commercial flights.\n\nRepresentative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, pushed back on the drone incursion explanation.\n\n\u201cI believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,\u201d Escobar said during a morning news conference.\n\nThere was \u201cnothing extraordinary about any drone incursion into the US that I\u2019m aware of\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThe information coming from the federal government does not add up,\u201d Escobar added later.\n\nThe airspace closure also drew backlash from other leaders, who said they were not properly consulted.\n\n\u201cThis unnecessary decision has caused chaos and confusion in the El Paso community,\u201d Renard Johnson, the mayor of El Paso, said at a news conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to be very, very clear that this should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership. That failure to communicate is unacceptable,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nMexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum denied the US claims that Mexican drones had entered US airspace.\n\n\u201cThere is no information about the use of drones at the border,\u201d she said.\n\nSecurity experts say drone incursions near sensitive sites are not uncommon, but the scale of the response in this case was unusual.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual that unidentified drones will wander over an airport or military base, causing short term disruption,\u201d Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior adviser with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is unprecedented that the FAA would seek to shut down a large piece of airspace for days,\u201d Cancian said.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to believe that they had thought through the economic and social costs of such an action,\u201d he added.\n\nClose to 3.5 million passengers travelled through El Paso international airport between January and November 2025, according to data on the airport\u2019s website.\n\nHow common are Mexican cartel drone incursions along the US border?\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has long warned that Mexican cartels are using drones along the border for drug smuggling activities.\n\nMexican officials have expressed less alarm, at times minimising the security threat posed by drone activity in the region.\n\nSteven Willoughby, deputy director of the counter-drone programme at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told Congress in July that cartels are using drones nearly every day across the border.\n\nAccording to DHS data, in the last six months of 2024, more than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 metres (1,640 feet) of the US southern border, mainly at night. He said that across the US-Mexico border, 326 flights a day were detected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a substantial amount of incursion by Mexican criminal groups\u2019 drones into US airspace, and they pose [a] great risk of colliding with civilian aircraft,\u201d Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on non-state armed groups at the Brookings Institution, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIn the case of El Paso, the risks were likely considered higher than in more remote desert areas,\u201d Felbab-Brown said.\n\n\u201cBut outside of the airports, there is a significant amount of drones belonging to Mexican criminal groups that have been penetrating US systems, both to gather reconnaissance on where law enforcement agents are present and on the route, but also to carry drug payloads,\u201d she said.\n\nAre drones being used in conflicts inside Mexico?\n\nExperts say drone technology is also being used inside Mexico, particularly in conflicts between rival criminal groups fighting for territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most prominent is the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel (CJNG), one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organisations, known for its rapid expansion and use of military-style tactics and new technologies.\n\nCJNG has clashed with Carteles Unidos, a loose alliance of smaller groups formed largely to resist CJNG\u2019s advance in the western state of Michoacan.\n\nIn rural parts of Michoacan, which include farming communities known as ejidos, drones have increasingly been used not only for surveillance but also to drop explosives during territorial disputes.\n\n\u201cIn the deployment of drones in Mexico, we have seen other activities by the cartels, such as carpet bombing of rural Eiridas in Michoacan, with the purpose of driving populations out of an ejido,\u201d Felbab-Brown, of Brookings Institution, explained.\n\n\u201cThe Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel has used these tactics to counter the local advantage of Carteles Unidos and their deep social roots in those communities. Unable to overcome that, they have tried to force people out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt various times, reporting from Michoacan has suggested that tens of thousands, and in some cases possibly hundreds of thousands, of people have been displaced from ejidos as a result of these scorched-earth tactics carried out using drones,\u201d she added."

    "content": "The vote was a rare rebuke against Trump from the Republican-led chamber, as Congress members face midterm elections.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has advanced a bill that would roll back President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, a signal of growing willingness among Republicans to break with his administration.\n\nWednesday\u2019s vote saw several Republicans cross party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe final tally saw 219 votes in favour of ending Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to slap tariffs on Canada. A minority, comprised of 211 representatives, voted against the bill.\n\nIt was a rare rebuke from Congress\u2019s lower chamber, where the Republican Party holds a 218-seat majority.\n\nBefore the vote, Democrats challenged their Republican colleagues to defy Trump, who has come to dominate the party.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J Trump?\u201d said Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, who authored the resolution.\n\nThe vote comes as the US enters its pivotal midterm election season. Primaries begin in March, and the general election unfolds in November.\n\nAll members of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in their respective districts.\n\nFaced with Trump\u2019s drooping approval rating, Republican representatives have faced the uncomfortable choice of either bucking his less-popular policies or remaining steadfast, despite possible blowback at the ballot box.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, threatened to derail the election prospects of any Republican who voted in favour of Wednesday\u2019s bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAny Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries,\u201d Trump wrote on social media in the lead-up to the vote.\n\nHe also accused Canada \u2013 one of the US\u2019s biggest trading partners and closest allies \u2013 of mistreating its southern neighbour.\n\n\u201cCanada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,\u201d Trump said in a second post.\n\n\u201cThey are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s bill now heads to the US Senate, where it is likely to pass.\n\nThat chamber had already passed similar legislation designed to curtail Trump\u2019s Canada tariff, first in April and later in October of last year.\n\nBut the legislation is unlikely to become law. Even if it passes the Senate, Trump is poised to veto the bill.\n\nCongress needs a two-thirds majority in each chamber to overcome a presidential veto. That would require substantial Republican defections, more than what happened during Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nStill, polls have shown that Trump\u2019s tariffs are largely unpopular with voters, who blame them in part for rising prices on a bevy of goods.\n\nOn February 4, for instance, the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of respondents disapprove of Trump increasing tariffs. Only 37 percent said they approved.\n\nDemocrats hope that the growing dissatisfaction, along with anger over Trump\u2019s aggressive mass deportation raids, will help them end Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court is also weighing the legality of Trump\u2019s wide-ranging tariffs, after the president faced defeat in lower-court rulings.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson had urged the Republican caucus to abstain from voting until the high court rendered its decision.\n\nBut six Republican representatives, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, defied him to help bring the measure to the floor for a vote.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we\u2019re an independent branch?\u201d said Representative Bacon. \u201cWe should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don\u2019t do it, shame on us.\u201d"

He is passionately committed to absolutely transforming the relationship between the United States and Venezuela, part of a broader agenda to make the Americas great again.\u201d\n\nA new era of expansion\n\nTrump has repeatedly outlined his vision for a new era of \u201cmanifest destiny\u201c, a 19th-century doctrine that champions US expansionism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, he has quipped about implementing the \u201cDonroe Doctrine\u201d, his version of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy platform that designates the entire Western Hemisphere as the US\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nPart of that push has been to bring countries throughout the Americas in line with US policy, whether through economic pressure, diplomatic efforts or military action.\n\nAn example of the latter came on January 3, when Trump authorised an early-morning military operation to attack Venezuela and abduct its then-leader, President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were then transported by military aircraft to New York. They are expected to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges in March.\n\nIn his first remarks after the military operation, Trump asserted that the US would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela.\n\nHe has since recognised the interim leadership of Maduro\u2019s former vice president, Rodriguez, though he has threatened a \u201csecond wave\u201d of military action if she fails to comply with his demands.\n\nClaiming Venezuela\u2019s oil\n\nTrump has also made sweeping claims to Venezuela\u2019s oil industry.\n\nIn his initial speech following the military operation, Trump reiterated claims that the country\u2019s petroleum resources belonged to the US, as a result of early oil exploration from companies like Exxon Mobil.\n\nTrump argued that Venezuela\u2019s efforts to nationalise its oil industry amounted to the \u201clargest theft of property in the history\u201d of the US.\n\n\u201cVenezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey took all of our property. It was our property. We built it.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised that his country, not Venezuela, should control the local oil reserves, though international law states otherwise.\n\nMultiple international resolutions and covenants outline that nations have permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources.\n\n\u201cWe built Venezuela\u2019s oil industry with American talent, drive and skill. And the socialist regime stole it from us during those previous administrations,\u201d Trump said on January 3.\n\nSince then, Trump has announced that Venezuela has turned over nearly 50 million barrels of oil to the US. That oil, Trump explained, is slated to be sold at market price for the benefit of both the US and Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThat money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America,\u201d Trump wrote online.\n\nHe also indicated he had tasked Wright to carry out the planned sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA presidential overstep?\n\nBut Trump has faced backlash for his aggressive approach to Venezuelan oil. Critics have pointed out that the US Constitution puts the power to manage money with Congress, not the president.\n\nThen there is the question of whether this oil was legally acquired from Venezuela in the first place, as Republican Congress member Thomas Massie pointed out last month.\n\n\u201cSelling stolen oil and putting billions of dollars in a bank in Qatar to be spent without Congressional approval is not Constitutional,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\n\u201cOnly Congress can appropriate money. The President can\u2019t legally create a second Treasury overseas for his own piggy bank.\u201d\n\nThe criticism continued on Wednesday. While Wright visited the Rodriguez administration, Democrats in the Senate introduced the Venezuela Oil Proceeds Transparency Act, designed to force a nonpartisan audit of the recent oil proceeds.\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Adam Schiff of California, criticised Trump\u2019s preoccupation with Venezuelan oil and questioned his motives for attacking Venezuela and its surrounding waters.\n\n\u201cFor months, the Trump administration claimed that its military operations in the Caribbean were about stopping drugs, but the objective is now abundantly clear: this was about seizing Venezuela\u2019s oil and lining the pockets of the oil industry,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber and the bill\u2019s co-sponsor, echoed Schiff\u2019s call for greater transparency.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know what\u2019s happening with the money received from these Venezuelan oil payments and where \u2013 and to whom \u2013 they are going,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nAn upbeat meeting\n\nBut the controversy in the US did not dampen the upbeat meeting Wright had with Rodriguez.\n\nWright\u2019s visit was the first of its kind for Venezuela. Under Maduro, Trump did send a special envoy, Richard Grenell, to the country in January 2025 to negotiate for the release of US prisoners.\n\nGrenell\u2019s negotiations with Maduro, however, ended in October, as the Trump administration ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government.\n\nSince Maduro\u2019s removal, the US Department of State has deployed a mission to Caracas, as the two countries work to reestablish diplomatic ties. The US has signalled it will soon reopen its embassy in Venezuela, which has been closed since 2019.\n\nBut no US official as senior as Wright has visited the country in years.\n\nRodriguez, meanwhile, has led an effort to comply with Trump\u2019s demands. On January 29, she signed into law a reform bill that would allow for increased privatisation in Venezuela\u2019s nationalised oil industry.\n\nOn Wednesday, she and Wright appeared together on the steps of the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas to present a summary of their meeting.\n\nWright pledged that Venezuela would see a \u201cdramatic increase in Venezuelan oil production\u201d, as well as a boost in the use of its other energy resources. He also promised \u201cto bring commerce, peace, prosperity, jobs, opportunity to the people of Venezuela and in partnership with the United States\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are not just words or ambitions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have very specific plans and very specific actions already.\u201d"
